    <content>This is Andalusia, in southern Spain. Midway up the mountain is the village of Mijas. The walls of the buildings were whitewashed in order to fend off the powerful rays of the sun, making it one of Andalusian's traditional "white villages." During the 1960's the walls were whitewashed with lime in order to protect the city from the harsh sunlight and disease, as well as to attract tourists. The whole town highlights the beauty of the white walls by cleaning them daily and growing colorful flowers. Due to these efforts, Mijas is now visited by tourists from around the world seeking to enjoy this spectacular "white village."</content>

Established during the 16th century by Spaniards who had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, the city proved to be a convenient and strategic base for colonial development.

Thus the Guarani culture is still a vital part of life in Asuncion today. In this episode we explore Asuncion and meet its residents who love their traditions and their distinctive culture.</content>
