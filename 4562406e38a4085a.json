      "content": "In this episode, we'll be making 3 uniquely Japanese sandwiches, made with Japanese ingredients, to be served like a multi-course meal. Our main sandwich features a Menchi-katsu ground meat cutlet: the crunchy fried panko bread crumbs and the juicy pork go perfectly with bread. We'll also be making a side sandwich with burdock root -- a popular vegetable in Japan -- and chicken, tossed with mayonnaise. For dessert, we have one more sandwich, filled with a combination of cream and a sweet bean paste made with Azuki beans, an indispensable ingredient for Japanese sweets. We hope you'll join us for these 3 convenient and delicious tastes of Japanese cuisine!",

The colors red and white are considered auspicious in Japan, so this sushi is topped with salmon and scallops, to make a dish perfect for serving at a house party! Our side dish is oyster Mizore-jiru soup, a warm dish that's especially good for the colder months. This soup is made with grated daikon radish for a look evocative of snow, and topped with yuzu citrus to give this elegant dish a bright yellow accent and a refreshing aroma. Chef Saito will also share some of the delicate presentation techniques used in Japanese cuisine.",
