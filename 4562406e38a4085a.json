We'll be introducing one of the many common rice bowls: Oyako-don. We'll show you the techniques needed to prepare the chicken and onion, with the great flavor of dashi and beaten egg, cooked until the egg is perfectly rich and fluffy, and then we'll top it with deliciously crisp Naganegi long onion to provide a great accent. We'll also be making another variant on Oyako-don, using flaked salmon -- a popular ingredient in bento lunches -- and salmon roe, for great taste and a fun texture. The green, yellow, red and pink of these dishes are sure to make them a colorful delight!",
