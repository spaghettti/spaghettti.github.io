Thinly sliced daikon radish, mizuna potherb mustard greens and pork are briefly dipped in a rich dashi soup to cook them. With Chef Saito's techniques, it's a delicious hot pot that you can make even without a lot of ingredients. After those ingredients have all been eaten, we'll be adding thin Inaniwa udon noodles to help pick up the soup for a delicious finish to the meal -- these noodles go great with hot pots!
