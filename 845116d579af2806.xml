Between the 17th and 19th centuries, Christianity was banned in Japan. From the government's viewpoint, the Christian faith had put down roots worryingly quickly after being introduced by Jesuits. During the ban, believers faced unimaginable persecution. But some held onto their faith, and devised ways to worship in secret. In the first half of a two-part special, Japanology Plus introduces the story of the Hidden Christians. Our guests include Kiyomi Morooka, a Catholic priest in Nagasaki Prefecture.</content>
