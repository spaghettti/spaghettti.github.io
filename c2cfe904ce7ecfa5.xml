    <content>The destruction of natural habitats in the name of economic growth has made a once common bird an endangered species. In June 2018, however, 19 "toki," or Japanese crested ibis were reintroduced into the wild, thanks to a breeding and release program led by veterinarian Yoshinori Kaneko. He says it's been a process of trial and error that includes working with Chinese researchers and calling on local farmers to cut back on pesticides. He talks about what it takes to live in harmony with nature.</content>
