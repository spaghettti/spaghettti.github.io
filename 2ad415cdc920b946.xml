    <content>6 months before JFK was killed, Lee Harvey Oswald attempted a separate assassination. Our coverage reveals the possibility that this attempt served as a focal point that linked Oswald to the JFK killing. The day of that killing, Oswald brought a rifle into a Dallas building. The US government report says 3 shots from that building killed JFK, but we take a new look at witness testimony and speak to 66 prominent campaigners to ask: was the assassination really the work of a "lone wolf"?</content>
