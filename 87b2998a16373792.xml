    <content>Cryptography, the computerized encoding and decoding of information, makes data exchanges on the internet secure. The current encryption system is based on the difficulty of factorizing huge numbers into prime numbers and cannot be solved easily even with supercomputers. However, the processing power of "quantum computers" has rapidly advanced in recent years posing a threat to cybersecurity. Researchers are now working to develop a new encryption system to protect data from quantum computing. One of the most important candidates is called "lattice-based cryptography." This system of finding hidden codes inside lattices is said to withstand quantum computers. Find out about the latest research in cryptography.

    <content>One of Japan's largest limestone caves, Akiyoshido extends out underground directly beneath a karst plateau known as Akiyoshidai in western Japan's Yamaguchi Prefecture. The entrance to a previously unexplored chamber was found on the ceiling of the massive cave, and an NHK film crew accompanied researchers and specialists on the investigation of this unknown area. After hours of climbing and traversing terrain that humans had never before covered, the team made their way deep into the new chamber and began conducting surveys using 3D technology. Cave researcher and research team leader Takashi Murakami joins us inside the studio to discuss their findings.

    <content>Atsuo Sasaki, associate professor at the University of Cincinnati discovered the metabolic mechanisms of cells which could open up new possibilities for cancer treatment. Guanosine triphosphate or GTP is the molecule that holds the key. Sasaki uncovered that a certain enzyme which reacted to GTP in cells acts as a "energy sensor" sending signals for cancer cells to grow. Furthermore, his recent study revealed the mechanism of nucleolus enlargement in highly malignant form of cancer cells, which had been a mystery for more than 100 years. Currently, he is conducting joint research to elucidate how his findings could be connected to metabolic diseases related to obesity. Find out how international collaboration is opening up potential uses for GTP research.</content>

    <content>Jellyfish have existed for 500 million years. Their great numbers and a diversity of some 4,000 species make them one of the most important creatures of the deep. A JAMSTEC research team has been garnering international attention for its study of jellyfish. Led by Australian marine biologist Dhugal Lindsay, the team is taking advantage of remote-controlled submersibles, 8K cameras and other new technologies to discover one new jellyfish species after the next. In February 2020, the team carried out surveys of Sagami Bay and Suruga Bay using a 15-camera submersible probe known as "Deep Tow." It's an ambitious attempt to get a complete picture of jellyfish and other creatures of the deep. Jellyfish have been the subject of numerous studies, about their longevity, how their population explosions occasionally impact the fishing industry and more. In this episode, we'll look at the latest of these studies, showing us the unknown charms and mysterious lives of jellyfish.</content>

    <content>The latest research has begun to unravel some of the mysteries behind dreaming. People typically dream at least 3 or 4 times a night, but many don't remember their dreams. Researchers now suspect that MCH neurons, which were thought to only regulate appetite, may be the reason why dreams are so easy to forget. Meanwhile, a new technique utilizing fMRI and AI to examine and analyze blood flow in the brain when a person is looking at an image has now enabled scientists to "peer" into a person's dream. In this episode, we'll look at these incredible results and other efforts to conduct research on the mechanisms of dreaming.

    <content>Planet Earth is home to humans and various life forms, but where did our ancestors come from? How did we evolve? While different theories on the origin of life include space and the deep sea, we will focus on deep underground. Numerous microorganisms, that are thought to be close to the common ancestor of all living organisms, have continued to live deep underground for tens of thousands of years. Find out more about the mysterious primitive organisms. Later in the program, we'll introduce a piece of research on sea urchins that could help restore the coastal ecosystem. Discover how clovers are being used to turn malnourished sea urchins into high-quality delicacies.</content>
