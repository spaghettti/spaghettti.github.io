    <content>2 special episodes of Science View filmed in Nagasaki Prefecture. Part 1 features medicine in Nagasaki. In the Edo period that lasted from the 17th to the 19th century, Japan adopted a policy that severely limited contact with the rest of the world. During this time, modern science made its way into Japan through Nagasaki, the only gateway to Western countries. Take a tour around a museum in Nagasaki City and discover how science spread all over Japan through medicine. Also visit Nagasaki University where they carry on the spirit of the first Western style medical school in Japan. Find out the university's latest research including the development of new drugs using a supercomputer as well as their contributions to combat new infectious diseases around the world.</content>
    <description>Nagasaki is crucial in the development of science in Japan. Discover the history of Western medicine entering Japan and how it led to the latest studies in Part 1 of 2 special episodes from Nagasaki.</description>

    <content>Cryptography, the computerized encoding and decoding of information, makes data exchanges on the internet secure. The current encryption system is based on the difficulty of factorizing huge numbers into prime numbers and cannot be solved easily even with supercomputers. However, the processing power of "quantum computers" has rapidly advanced in recent years posing a threat to cybersecurity. Researchers are now working to develop a new encryption system to protect data from quantum computing. One of the most important candidates is called "lattice-based cryptography." This system of finding hidden codes inside lattices is said to withstand quantum computers. Find out about the latest research in cryptography.

    <content>The technology of projection mapping is rapidly advancing. Images can be projected not only onto stationary surfaces such as buildings and walls, but also onto fast-moving objects. Undistorted images are appearing on bouncing balls and T-shirts. And now, this technology goes beyond the realm of entertainment, bringing hope to saving people's lives. It is about to be applied even in the field of medicine. Find out about the latest development in projection mapping and how it can change our lives.

    <content>The latest research has begun to unravel some of the mysteries behind dreaming. People typically dream at least 3 or 4 times a night, but many don't remember their dreams. Researchers now suspect that MCH neurons, which were thought to only regulate appetite, may be the reason why dreams are so easy to forget. Meanwhile, a new technique utilizing fMRI and AI to examine and analyze blood flow in the brain when a person is looking at an image has now enabled scientists to "peer" into a person's dream. In this episode, we'll look at these incredible results and other efforts to conduct research on the mechanisms of dreaming.

    <content>Airag, a dairy product made by fermenting horse milk, has been an integral part of life for Mongolia's nomadic people. In 2019, the traditional technique of making Airag was registered as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. It has since attracted worldwide attention with the growing awareness in health consciousness. While much about Airag-making still remains unknown, the traditional knowledge may disappear as more nomads move to the city. Professor Yuki Morinaga of Meiji University has been investigating and recording the traditional method of Airag production for 8 years. Discover the simple and sustainable life of nomads through Morinaga's research on Airag.</content>

    <content>The novel coronavirus pandemic is showing no signs of stopping. Scientists are scrambling to understand the invisible enemy through studying its genome, the blueprint of the virus. By analyzing the genome of coronaviruses from around the world, researchers can grasp the characteristics and track the spread of the outbreak. Genomic expert So Nakagawa and his team uncovered the stunning ability of the coronavirus to escape our immune responses from its genome. He will help explain one of the causes for asymptomatic cases. Find out the latest on what we have learned through unlocking the genetic code of the coronavirus.</content>
