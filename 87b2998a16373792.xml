    <content>Polymers like polyethylene or plastic are essential in modern life, yet their molecular structure makes them brittle. However, researchers have recently improved that molecular structure to create new tough polymers, which can be 100 times stronger. Some are already on the verge of being used in practical applications, and are expected to be used in areas such as automobiles and their components. We'll look at the development of these new tough polymers.

    <content>Japan is a country known for its frequent volcanic eruptions. It's also experienced much larger "massive volcanic eruptions" thought to have struck at an average rate of once every 10,000 years. These eruptions were so powerful that they helped form the Japanese archipelago. The most recent massive volcanic eruption is to have occurred 7,300 years ago at the Kikai Caldera, which includes the island of Satsuma-Iojima in southern Kyushu. In this episode, we'll look at the latest research on massive volcanic eruptions and the insight gained from the Kikai Caldera.

    <content>Cryptography, the computerized encoding and decoding of information, makes data exchanges on the internet secure. The current encryption system is based on the difficulty of factorizing huge numbers into prime numbers and cannot be solved easily even with supercomputers. However, the processing power of "quantum computers" has rapidly advanced in recent years posing a threat to cybersecurity. Researchers are now working to develop a new encryption system to protect data from quantum computing. One of the most important candidates is called "lattice-based cryptography." This system of finding hidden codes inside lattices is said to withstand quantum computers. Find out about the latest research in cryptography.

    <content>One of Japan's largest limestone caves, Akiyoshido extends out underground directly beneath a karst plateau known as Akiyoshidai in western Japan's Yamaguchi Prefecture. The entrance to a previously unexplored chamber was found on the ceiling of the massive cave, and an NHK film crew accompanied researchers and specialists on the investigation of this unknown area. After hours of climbing and traversing terrain that humans had never before covered, the team made their way deep into the new chamber and began conducting surveys using 3D technology. Cave researcher and research team leader Takashi Murakami joins us inside the studio to discuss their findings.

    <content>Atsuo Sasaki, associate professor at the University of Cincinnati discovered the metabolic mechanisms of cells which could open up new possibilities for cancer treatment. Guanosine triphosphate or GTP is the molecule that holds the key. Sasaki uncovered that a certain enzyme which reacted to GTP in cells acts as a "energy sensor" sending signals for cancer cells to grow. Furthermore, his recent study revealed the mechanism of nucleolus enlargement in highly malignant form of cancer cells, which had been a mystery for more than 100 years. Currently, he is conducting joint research to elucidate how his findings could be connected to metabolic diseases related to obesity. Find out how international collaboration is opening up potential uses for GTP research.</content>

    <content>Jellyfish have existed for 500 million years. Their great numbers and a diversity of some 4,000 species make them one of the most important creatures of the deep. A JAMSTEC research team has been garnering international attention for its study of jellyfish. Led by Australian marine biologist Dhugal Lindsay, the team is taking advantage of remote-controlled submersibles, 8K cameras and other new technologies to discover one new jellyfish species after the next. In February 2020, the team carried out surveys of Sagami Bay and Suruga Bay using a 15-camera submersible probe known as "Deep Tow." It's an ambitious attempt to get a complete picture of jellyfish and other creatures of the deep. Jellyfish have been the subject of numerous studies, about their longevity, how their population explosions occasionally impact the fishing industry and more. In this episode, we'll look at the latest of these studies, showing us the unknown charms and mysterious lives of jellyfish.</content>

    <content>Predicted by Albert Einstein about 100 years ago, gravitational waves are ripples in space-time caused by the movement of a celestial body with huge mass. The ripples disrupt space-time and create waves that travel at the speed of light. On February 25, 2020, Japan's first gravitational wave detector KAGRA began full-scale operation. Detectors like KAGRA enable conventional telescopes that observe visible, infrared and electromagnetic waves to be used much more effectively, and they are bringing about a new era in astronomy. An NHK film crew had a chance to take a special tour of KAGRA before operation began, and in this episode, we'll take a sneak peek at its sapphire mirrors and other high-tech equipment that give it the world's best performance.

    <content>The aurora is a beautiful display of light in the night sky. There are even places near the North and South Poles where the aurora continues to appear for 24 hours. One such place is the Svalbard Islands in the Arctic Circle, where it's dark all day during the winter months, making the archipelago an aurora hotspot. Using a special all-sky camera array, NHK videographers recorded the aurora there for nearly an entire day. Their footage clearly showed a beautiful green aurora, but also managed to capture the mysterious red aurora as well. In this episode, we'll learn what causes the aurora and why it's sometimes red.

    <content>The latest research has begun to unravel some of the mysteries behind dreaming. People typically dream at least 3 or 4 times a night, but many don't remember their dreams. Researchers now suspect that MCH neurons, which were thought to only regulate appetite, may be the reason why dreams are so easy to forget. Meanwhile, a new technique utilizing fMRI and AI to examine and analyze blood flow in the brain when a person is looking at an image has now enabled scientists to "peer" into a person's dream. In this episode, we'll look at these incredible results and other efforts to conduct research on the mechanisms of dreaming.

    <content>Japanese indigo is famous for producing a traditional dye known as "Japan blue." Now, more and more hidden powers of the indigo plant are being discovered for applications in medicine and agriculture. The plant's antibacterial properties are well known, but research has now revealed that a substance called "tryptanthrin" is the reason. Tryptanthrin may also inhibit the growth of viruses as well. Moreover, a strawberry farm in Aomori Prefecture discovered that strawberries grew bigger when strawberry plants were given a liquid extracted from indigo. Analysis showed that indigo extract helped plant roots grow faster than usual, and researchers suspect it may even increase the yield of other agricultural products too. In this episode, we will examine how indigo today is being used for more than just a pretty dye!

    <content>After the Hayabusa-2 mission successfully brought samples from the surface of an asteroid back to Earth, Japan next plans to apply this know-how to the moons of Mars. The Martian Moons eXploration mission will land on the moon Phobos, collect samples, and then return them to Earth. Team member Kiyoshi Kuramoto joins us to discuss the origins of these moons, the challenges of landing in ultra-low gravity, the possible connections to water and life on Earth, and more. We'll also look at a redesigned dental instrument for root canal procedures.</content>

    <content>Did you hear that? No? Well, it might have been one of a growing number of applications for sounds outside the range of human hearing. In this episode, sound expert Shohei Yano joins us to discuss the many ways that inaudible sound is being used for everything from kabuki to farming to tornadoes. And he'll tell us how his own company is working on devices that use people's ear canal shapes for security that sometimes works even better than face recognition. We'll also see how a metalsmith overcame the challenges of titanium to produce light, durable and good-looking drinking tumblers.</content>
