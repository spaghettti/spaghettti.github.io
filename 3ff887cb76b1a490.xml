    <content>In March 2020, JR Freight opened a large-scale distribution center, "Tokyo Rail Gate West." This center was set up as an all-in-one facility to store and transport goods easily and efficiently in response to a nationwide shortage of long-haul truck drivers. Compared to road freight, rail freight has less impact on the environment and requires fewer workers to operate (a boon in the time of COVID-19). See JR Freight's plans to become a total-service distributor after the coronavirus pandemic.</content>
