    <content>On April 1, 2019, the Yubari branch of JR Hokkaido's Sekisho Line is sadly coming to an end.

See the last moments of this beloved line and the challenges local lines are facing in Japan.</content>

    <content>Across Japan there are 95 local railways, many of which are now struggling to survive. The aging population, a declining birth rate, an increase in motorists and the poor financial situation of local governments have made things difficult for the railway industry.

    <content>In March 2020, JR Freight opened a large-scale distribution center, "Tokyo Rail Gate West." This center was set up as an all-in-one facility to store and transport goods easily and efficiently in response to a nationwide shortage of long-haul truck drivers. Compared to road freight, rail freight has less impact on the environment and requires fewer workers to operate (a boon in the time of COVID-19). See JR Freight's plans to become a total-service distributor after the coronavirus pandemic.</content>
