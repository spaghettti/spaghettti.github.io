    <content>Our stage this time is the Notsuke Peninsula that stretches approximately 26 kilometers in the east of Hokkaido Prefecture. Its curvature is the result of sand and rocks deposited by the tides, and the natural environment found here is even rare in Hokkaido. Our program host takes a boat to places you cannot reach on foot, encountering the unique and strange landscape as well as its wild inhabitants. Furthermore, our camera crew dives into the shallow ocean surrounding the peninsula, and introduces you to the underwater forest of seaweed and its precious ecology.</content>

    <content>Our stage this time is Lake Saroma, the largest lake in Hokkaido Prefecture, facing the Sea of Okhotsk. Seawater and fresh water are mixed together in this lake, and when the tide is low, tidal flats are revealed, attracting wild birds in search of food. The program host enjoys bird watching in the lake where various wild birds gather. Some rare birds are also seen here, taking a break during their migration. Later, we show you some footage of the wildflowers that bloom in the lake's sandy soil of the wildflower park, as well as the wild birds that raise their young.</content>

    <content>Our stage this time is Sounkyo. It is located in the Daisetsu mountain range, almost in the center of Hokkaido Prefecture. It is a ravine with cliffs as high as 200 meters, created by volcanic activities that occurred 30,000 years ago. In autumn, the area is beautifully colored with autumn leaves. The program host rides a bicycle and encounters the beautiful scenery that the ravine offers. Further, he climbs Mt. Kurodake, which is over 1,900 meters above sea level, to fully enjoy its scenery as autumn deepens. Later, we show you some footage of wildlife inhabiting this area, filmed during fall and winter.</content>
