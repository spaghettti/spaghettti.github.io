The river, which runs through a flat farmland, has a gentle current and provides a hiding place for large rainbow trout. We visited the river with 2 fishers this time, one of whom tries a Western fly-fishing method, and the other one tries his hand at "Tenkara," the Japanese method of hook-and-line fishing, to catch a large fish over 40 centimeters in length. Later, we also show you the fantastic scenery created by the gentle current of the Tokachi River during the severe winter months.</content>
