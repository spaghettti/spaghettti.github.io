    <content>Our stage this time is the Notsuke Peninsula that stretches approximately 26 kilometers in the east of Hokkaido Prefecture.

Furthermore, our camera crew dives into the shallow ocean surrounding the peninsula, and introduces you to the underwater forest of seaweed and its precious ecology.</content>
