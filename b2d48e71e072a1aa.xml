    <content>Our stage this time is the Notsuke Peninsula that stretches approximately 26 kilometers in the east of Hokkaido Prefecture. Its curvature is the result of sand and rocks deposited by the tides, and the natural environment found here is even rare in Hokkaido. Our program host takes a boat to places you cannot reach on foot, encountering the unique and strange landscape as well as its wild inhabitants. Furthermore, our camera crew dives into the shallow ocean surrounding the peninsula, and introduces you to the underwater forest of seaweed and its precious ecology.</content>
