International discussions about reducing greenhouse gas emissions have been ongoing, but no significant steps have been taken. In the interim, temperatures keep rising in many places, and extreme weather events are more frequent. Some say it is impossible to completely withdraw from carbon energies. But Mark Jacobson has a plan to replace them with 100% clean renewables. We asked Prof. Jacobson how we can tackle this issue.",

While vaccinations are now underway in the U.S. and other countries, variants have emerged, and cases are rising in some regions. So, are vaccines the light at the end of a long tunnel? Professor Iwasaki shares insights on vaccination, variants and the long-term effects of COVID-19.",
