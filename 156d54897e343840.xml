    <content>Setsuko Thurlow was 13 when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Horrific scenes of pain and destruction were burned into her memory. She moved to the US and Canada and began to tell the world what had happened in Hiroshima. Her work with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) overcame resistance from nuclear powers and resulted in the adoption of a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons. Their efforts earned the group the Nobel Peace Prize. This gripping documentary follows Setsuko's journey from a childhood wracked by war to international recognition.</content>

While most of the masons lost their jobs, one family in Sakamoto survived by refurbishing old ruins. But the 15th-generation master Suminori Awata is worried about the future. One day he receives an unexpected request to build a castle-style wall in Texas. Awata's journey begins.</content>

    <content>Under his motto, "shine a light on a small corner of the world," Dr. Nakamura Tetsu devoted his life to aiding the people of Afghanistan, until he was shot to death there in December 2019. For decades, he treated patients and built clinics to provide ongoing care to underserved people. When devastating droughts hit the country, he launched projects to build irrigation canals. Assisting the doctor's efforts were about one hundred young Japanese, who the doctor referred to as "workers." Some came after suffering setbacks in Japan. Others arrived with a vision of making a difference in the world. In this program, they reflect on how their time with Nakamura changed their lives, and how the doctor's voice reverberates in their hearts still today.</content>
