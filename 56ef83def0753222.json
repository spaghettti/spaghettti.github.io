With the help of top experts, NHK takes a new look at the incident through reenactments and fresh theories on the case.\nLee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed JFK, was once a US Marine stationed in Atsugi, Japan who later defected to the Soviet Union. While his own upbringing played a role in his decisions, there is also a possibility that a certain organization was manipulating him behind the scenes. The testimony of Oswald's wife, Marina, also reveals a failed assassination attempt by Oswald in the months leading up to Kennedy's death. We follow the little-known footprints left by this infamous assassin.",

Our coverage reveals the possibility that this attempt served as a focal point that linked Oswald to the JFK killing. The day of that killing, Oswald brought a rifle into a Dallas building. The US government report says 3 shots from that building killed JFK, but we take a new look at witness testimony and speak to 66 prominent campaigners to ask: was the assassination really the work of a \"lone wolf\"?",

Meanwhile, \"essential\" workers, including nurses, risk their lives on the frontlines, often under miserable conditions and for low pay. Many hospitals are struggling to pay the bills. The pandemic has forced us to ask: \"What jobs are truly important and how should they be compensated?\" We look at 2 very different kinds of work in a search for answers.",

The new law came after more than a year of protests that at times saw the city rocked by scenes of violence and destruction. While some believe the law has helped bring Hong Kong back from the brink, many others are now afraid to even voice their views for fear of prosecution. In a city increasingly divided along political lines, we hear both the hopes and fears of Hongkongers caught up in these unprecedented times.",

These prisoners were deemed \"traitors\" amidst the shadows of the largest mass extermination program in human history. What took place within the inferno? More than 7 decades later, this disturbing, tragic reality is brought to light.",
