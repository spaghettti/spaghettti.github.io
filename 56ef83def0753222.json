With the help of top experts, NHK takes a new look at the incident through reenactments and fresh theories on the case.\nLee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed JFK, was once a US Marine stationed in Atsugi, Japan who later defected to the Soviet Union. While his own upbringing played a role in his decisions, there is also a possibility that a certain organization was manipulating him behind the scenes. The testimony of Oswald's wife, Marina, also reveals a failed assassination attempt by Oswald in the months leading up to Kennedy's death. We follow the little-known footprints left by this infamous assassin.",

The documentary begins in 2005, years before the devastating 2011 tsunami. The southeasterly wind called the Inasa is the long-time companion of locals in their everyday endeavors, and is said to bring good catches and rich harvests.

As a global pandemic continues, discover the quiet strength of the people who live and died in the small community of Arahama.",

      "content": "A decade on from its triple core meltdown, we take stock of the mammoth task of decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, an undertaking fraught with both technical and social challenges. The Japanese government maintains the process will take up to 40 years, but the schedule has already been revised 5 times, with pivotal elements postponed. Meanwhile, as people return to their homes in surrounding areas, the issue of how to dispose of unprecedented volumes of radioactive waste has become a sore point of contention between residents and the government. We look back on the 10 years since the nuclear disaster and explore the choices that will shape Fukushima's future.",
