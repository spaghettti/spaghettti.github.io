With the help of top experts, NHK takes a new look at the incident through reenactments and fresh theories on the case.\nLee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed JFK, was once a US Marine stationed in Atsugi, Japan who later defected to the Soviet Union. While his own upbringing played a role in his decisions, there is also a possibility that a certain organization was manipulating him behind the scenes. The testimony of Oswald's wife, Marina, also reveals a failed assassination attempt by Oswald in the months leading up to Kennedy's death. We follow the little-known footprints left by this infamous assassin.",

What gives her speed in her wheelchair is not just raw strength, but also her exceptional command of her arms. She has this power because of remarkable adaptations within her body. To explore this further, we went to Russia, where McFadden spent her early childhood, and discovered that the first years of her life were unimaginably harsh.
