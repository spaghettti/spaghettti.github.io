With the help of top experts, NHK takes a new look at the incident through reenactments and fresh theories on the case.\nLee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed JFK, was once a US Marine stationed in Atsugi, Japan who later defected to the Soviet Union. While his own upbringing played a role in his decisions, there is also a possibility that a certain organization was manipulating him behind the scenes. The testimony of Oswald's wife, Marina, also reveals a failed assassination attempt by Oswald in the months leading up to Kennedy's death. We follow the little-known footprints left by this infamous assassin.",

In the 20th century, Tokyo was razed to the ground twice, first by natural disaster, then by war, yet countless businesses found the resilience to rebuild and survive amid destruction and hardship. Actor Sato Takeru takes us on a tour of artisanal businesses keeping alive unique, age-old traditions, as he explores the roots of their longevity.",

While some believe the law has helped bring Hong Kong back from the brink, many others are now afraid to even voice their views for fear of prosecution. In a city increasingly divided along political lines, we hear both the hopes and fears of Hongkongers caught up in these unprecedented times.",
