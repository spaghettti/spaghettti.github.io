    <content>Recipes are often developed over several lifetimes of work, lovingly crafted and passed on from generation to generation. These dishes represent much more than home cooking. This program delves into traditional recipes to shine a light on unique food cultures across Japan, and discover the older generation's seasoned philosophies of life.
Tami Hiyama, 92 years old, lives alone in Fukuoka City, where she has taught home cooking for more than 60 years. We learn her recipe for "chirashi-zushi," a special kind of sushi eaten at family celebrations. Tami prepares the finest ingredients but she says mindset is just as important -- she cooks the dish imagining those who will soon enjoy it. What does "chirashi-zushi" mean to 92-year-old Tami? We discover her recipes for life and the secrets of her good health.</content>

    <content>In winter, men and women sheltered in strange shell-like tents patiently wait on the frozen surface of a picturesque mountain lake in central Japan. They come for Japanese pond smelt, a fish as marvelous to look at as it is tasty, especially in tempura. Catching it is not for the casual, but for the most passionate of anglers - those willing to meticulously craft their own rods or go as far as building a computer controlled fishing robot. Witness the mad enthusiasm of these innovators on ice.</content>

The Hotel Okura Tokyo is one of Japan's leading hotels. In anticipation of demand for the Olympics, the hotel was reopened last September after 5 years of renovation. Due to COVID-19 situation, some of the hotel's facilities, including restaurants and bars, have been closed with weddings and banquets being canceled. It will likely take some time to regain its long-established status as a hotel. Meanwhile, the 17-story, 240-room Sequence Miyashita Park, built in Shibuya, was scheduled to open on June 11. A sense of urgency about the second wave has left it unable to set an opening date. We focus on these old and new hotels in Tokyo.</content>

Ever since Jiyu Gakuen opened in 1921, students had been preparing school lunches themselves. Preparing and sharing meals together is a valuable opportunity for students to socialize and bond. It's a tradition the school has proudly preserved over the years. Since the campus has been closed, naturally, the dining hall too remains empty. Can the school keep this legacy going in spite of the pandemic? As the school reopens after a period of about 6 months, the first phase of lunch preparation begins. We follow the challenges of students and teachers.</content>

6 months after the suspension of inbound tourism, a government domestic tourism campaign saw demand for Tokyo hotels both old and new begin to recover. Alongside banquet sales, particularly for weddings, sales of take-out Christmas dinners reflected demand for stay-at-home services. One new Shibuya hotel saw an upswing in reservations, with some rooms repurposed for use as workspace. But now coronavirus cases in Tokyo are rising rapidly, forcing the government to make a difficult decision.</content>

In this series, we look inside 3 places in this megacity. Hotels, where many people stay. Schools, where young people gather. And airports, major transportation hubs. We'll bring you insight on how the people in these places are trying to recover.
The fall 2020 campaign to boost domestic travel helped bring old and new hotels back to life. But late in the year, infection figures surged and Tokyo issued a second state of emergency. At one long-established hotel, a couple forced to postpone a large wedding once before faced having to do so again. A new hotel in Shibuya has taken measures such as reducing employee attendance to two-thirds, while finding a way to increase workspace by remodeling rooms and use the lobby as a gallery space.</content>

    <content>The ninja are said to have been capable of remembering extensive details about the estates and castles they infiltrated. To learn how they were able to recall large amounts of information without taking notes, we take a look at some of the mnemonic devices mentioned in ninja documents. In the latter half of the program, we examine torches developed by the ninja. With the help of a pyrotechnician, we recreate a Mizukakyo, or water-resistant torch, using ingredients of the time. Join us to see the experiment results!</content>

    <content>A city known for its soy sauce production, Choshi lies 100km east of Tokyo, in Chiba Prefecture. Soy sauce production began during Japan's Edo era, although it was widely used on sushi and tempura before then. But why Choshi? For Ground Detective Simon Wallis, the hints this time are "hard coastal rock" and "flatlands," which are said to be particularly suited to soy sauce production. But how could geology make such a difference? The Ground Detective is on the case!</content>

    <content>The Watari Museum of Contemporary Art, or the "Watari-um," is a privately-owned museum in Tokyo's central Shibuya Ward. In 1990, it was constructed from a design by architect Mario Botta in a uniquely triangular shape. Founder Watari Shizuko and her children Etsuko and Koichi held close dialogues with artists in order to present the most cutting-edge art. For a limited time in 2021, the museum will erect "art pavilions" all around Tokyo, as they seek out new perspectives in artistic beauty.</content>

    <content>Deep in the countryside is the peaceful area of Maru-bashira in Iga in southern-central Japan. This tiny village of only about 650 people has long been known for a type of pottery called Iga ware. Even today, several potteries continue this craft. Fukumori Michiho is one of them carrying on the tradition. For over 400 years, her family's pottery has been firing its kilns. Michiho pours her heart and soul into making earthenware pots called "donabe." Her hope is that modern generations will come to appreciate this time-honored cookware. Creating her very own "donabe" recipes, she wants to see these traditional pots once again become a familiar sight in kitchens across Japan.</content>

    <content>"It's kami (gods) that have helped us for generations." So says Sato Akihito (82), a 19th-generation Ai, or indigo, producer. Digging into a hot mound of Ai, he immediately knows what the Ai "wants." Ai makes an almost mystical color due to time, several fermentation processes and constant care. It requires a delicate balance between the power of humans and Ai, as well as dye artisans who are dedicated to the craft of Aizome, or indigo dyeing. We take a look at the incessant dialog between humans, fungus and plant matter, which epitomizes the Japanese attitude towards nature and beauty.</content>

    <content>Yamamoto Yasuo (age 48), a 5th-generation soy sauce producer on Shodoshima Island in western Japan, started crafting wooden barrels himself. This was to preserve the traditional wooden barrel brewing method of soy sauce for the next generation. The body and flavor of soy sauce are imbued by microorganisms that inhabit the wooden barrels and breweries. However, due to industrialization, wooden barrel craftspeople have disappeared and usable wooden barrels could be lost in a few decades. Mr. Yamamoto started to reach out to fellow soy sauce brewers across Japan to encourage them to use his wooden barrels. "My job is not to make soy sauce. It is to connect our generation with the next. My ancestors have done the same." We'll take a close look at the Yamamoto and his unique way of having dual professions of crafting wooden barrels and brewing soy sauce.</content>

    <content>At the foot of the Nikko mountains lives Yamamoto Yuichiro (age 70) and his son Jin-ichiro (45), who, without relying on any machines, produce the hardest natural ice in Japan. The season begins in late fall when they adjust the amount of spring water daily while waiting for cold weather. If the first centimeter freezes solid, then it will make fine ice. But if it doesn't, they will have to break it and start over. Yuichiro says, "Man can only do very little to nature. So the ice artisan's job is to just help the ice to grow without fighting nature." In December, they scrape snow to help the ice freeze and keep careful watch as it slowly grows until harvest time in 3 months. We take a close look at the efforts of these men who produce hard-to-melt ice in harmony with nature.</content>
