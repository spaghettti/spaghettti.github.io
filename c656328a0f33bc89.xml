    <content>The coronavirus has changed everything. How can we overcome this crisis? How can we restore our normal lifestyles? In Japan, Tokyo had the largest number of coronavirus infections. In this series, we look inside 3 places in this megacity. Hotels, where many people stay. Schools, where young people gather. And airports, major transportation hubs. We'll bring you insight on how the people in these places are trying to recover.
With 87 million passengers per year, Haneda Airport is one of the world's busiest. But with COVID-19 wiping out most of its sales, it is now struggling to stay afloat. The opening of Haneda Airport Garden, an adjoining multi-use complex with lodging and a bus terminal, originally scheduled for April of 2020, has now been indefinitely put on hold. In this program we focus on some of the key people fighting the uphill battle of restoring the airport to its former glory.</content>
