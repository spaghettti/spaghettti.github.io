Every autumn, its so-called \"Pear Street\" fills up with farmers hawking their wares. Those farmers have thought up clever ways to make large, sweet pears, like growing branches across horizontal trellises that match the farmer's height.

This time, we visit Japan's largest peanut production area, Chiba Prefecture, and learn about a traditional, machine-free drying method that gets the most sweetness out of the peanuts. We also sample a variety of local peanut dishes, meet scientists who spend some 15 years perfecting each new variety, and even try peanut ramen! (Reporter: Jason Hancock)",
