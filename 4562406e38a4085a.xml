    <content>Our theme for this episode is topped rice bowls. A bowl of rice with delicious toppings is a quick and easy single-dish meal popular in Japan. We'll be introducing one of the many common rice bowls: Oyako-don. We'll show you the techniques needed to prepare the chicken and onion, with the great flavor of dashi and beaten egg, cooked until the egg is perfectly rich and fluffy, and then we'll top it with deliciously crisp Naganegi long onion to provide a great accent. We'll also be making another variant on Oyako-don, using flaked salmon -- a popular ingredient in bento lunches -- and salmon roe, for great taste and a fun texture. The green, yellow, red and pink of these dishes are sure to make them a colorful delight!</content>

    <content>Our theme for this time is hot pots. Chef Saito will be making Hari-hari hot pot, a delicious favorite perfect for cold winter days. Thinly sliced daikon radish, mizuna potherb mustard greens and pork are briefly dipped in a rich dashi soup to cook them. With Chef Saito's techniques, it's a delicious hot pot that you can make even without a lot of ingredients. After those ingredients have all been eaten, we'll be adding thin Inaniwa udon noodles to help pick up the soup for a delicious finish to the meal -- these noodles go great with hot pots!

We'll be making Kabura-mushi, or steamed turnip, steaming pure white grated turnip together with shrimp and vegetables for a beautiful traditional Japanese dish.

    <content>In this two-part episode, our host Yu Hayami will be visiting the Tango region of Kyoto Prefecture, known as the "back room of Kyoto" and home to many developments in Japanese cuisine over the years. This region has long enjoyed incredible natural beauty and bounty from both land and sea, such as Amanohashidate -- considered one of Japan's 3 most beautiful views -- as well as outstanding foods like premium "taiza-gani" snow crab, and Tango's unparalleled Koshihikari rice. In this first half of Yu's visit, we'll be learning about Barazushi, a local variety of sushi that is a natural fit for a region that has flourished as a grower of rice. We'll be talking with Chef Osamu Maekawa, who has worked to share Barazushi with the rest of Japan, and he'll show us a recipe that anyone can try at home.</content>

We'll be using shrimp, corn and other colorful ingredients, and Chef Rika will share her secret technique to easily make crunchy, delicious tempura. For our side dish, we'll be making chrysanthemum greens seasoned with vinegar -- the perfect match for Ten Don! The mild bitterness of the chrysanthemum greens goes wonderfully with the flavor of the vinegar, for a deliciously refreshing side dish.</content>

We'll be making chicken miso gratin, for a Japanese take on Western-style ingredients: stir-fried chicken and boiled potatoes, covered with béchamel sauce seasoned with miso, then heated in the toaster oven until browned and delicious. The secrets to this dish's rich flavor are kombu kelp dashi, full of savory umami flavor and miso -- and they go great with béchamel sauce! For our side dish, we'll be making spicy simmered Konnyaku and lotus root. These 2 characteristic Japanese ingredients are stir-fried and seasoned with a soy sauce-based sauce, for a great combination of the chewy texture of the Konnyaku and the crunchiness of the lotus root. Adding red chili pepper helps give them a delicious bit of heat as an accent, for a side that goes great with drinks, too!</content>
