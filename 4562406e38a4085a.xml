    <content>Our theme for this episode is topped rice bowls. A bowl of rice with delicious toppings is a quick and easy single-dish meal popular in Japan. We'll be introducing one of the many common rice bowls: Oyako-don. We'll show you the techniques needed to prepare the chicken and onion, with the great flavor of dashi and beaten egg, cooked until the egg is perfectly rich and fluffy, and then we'll top it with deliciously crisp Naganegi long onion to provide a great accent. We'll also be making another variant on Oyako-don, using flaked salmon -- a popular ingredient in bento lunches -- and salmon roe, for great taste and a fun texture. The green, yellow, red and pink of these dishes are sure to make them a colorful delight!</content>

    <content>Our theme for this time is hot pots. Chef Saito will be making Hari-hari hot pot, a delicious favorite perfect for cold winter days. Thinly sliced daikon radish, mizuna potherb mustard greens and pork are briefly dipped in a rich dashi soup to cook them. With Chef Saito's techniques, it's a delicious hot pot that you can make even without a lot of ingredients. After those ingredients have all been eaten, we'll be adding thin Inaniwa udon noodles to help pick up the soup for a delicious finish to the meal -- these noodles go great with hot pots! And for dessert, we'll be having persimmon topped with a homemade sesame sauce.</content>

We'll also be making delicious and nutritious Kayaku Gohan, or rice with chicken and various vegetables mixed in.</content>
