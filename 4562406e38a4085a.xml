    <content>Our theme for this episode is steaming. We'll be making Kabura-mushi, or steamed turnip, steaming pure white grated turnip together with shrimp and vegetables for a beautiful traditional Japanese dish. The fluffy white of the grated turnip is evocative of snow, and the thick and shiny yet clear sauce shimmers like ice, giving it a look wonderfully reminiscent of winter scenery in Japan. We'll also be making delicious and nutritious Kayaku Gohan, or rice with chicken and various vegetables mixed in.</content>
    <description>Today's recipe: (1) Kabura-mushi "Steamed Turnips" (2) Kayaku-gohan "Mixed Rice." Why not learn Japanese food culture and try real Japanese dishes at your home!</description>

    <content>In this episode, we'll be making 3 uniquely Japanese sandwiches, made with Japanese ingredients, to be served like a multi-course meal. Our main sandwich features a Menchi-katsu ground meat cutlet: the crunchy fried panko bread crumbs and the juicy pork go perfectly with bread. We'll also be making a side sandwich with burdock root -- a popular vegetable in Japan -- and chicken, tossed with mayonnaise. For dessert, we have one more sandwich, filled with a combination of cream and a sweet bean paste made with Azuki beans, an indispensable ingredient for Japanese sweets. We hope you'll join us for these 3 convenient and delicious tastes of Japanese cuisine!</content>

    <content>In this episode, we'll be making Ten Don, or tempura rice bowls, a popular dish in Japan. We'll be using shrimp, corn and other colorful ingredients, and Chef Rika will share her secret technique to easily make crunchy, delicious tempura. For our side dish, we'll be making chrysanthemum greens seasoned with vinegar -- the perfect match for Ten Don! The mild bitterness of the chrysanthemum greens goes wonderfully with the flavor of the vinegar, for a deliciously refreshing side dish.</content>

    <content>Our theme for this episode is decorating. We'll be making Temari sushi, a charming bite-sized style of sushi with beautiful toppings, said to have originated in Kyoto Prefecture. The colors red and white are considered auspicious in Japan, so this sushi is topped with salmon and scallops, to make a dish perfect for serving at a house party! Our side dish is oyster Mizore-jiru soup, a warm dish that's especially good for the colder months. This soup is made with grated daikon radish for a look evocative of snow, and topped with yuzu citrus to give this elegant dish a bright yellow accent and a refreshing aroma. Chef Saito will also share some of the delicate presentation techniques used in Japanese cuisine.</content>

    <content>Our theme for this episode is seasoning. We'll be making a stir-fry, a home-cooked dish popular for its casual simplicity, and add a seasoning made with miso to give it a deliciously sophisticated flavor. Chef Saito will share his own unique seasoning blend, too: by mixing miso with other distinctively Japanese seasonings, you too can bring out the best of ingredients' flavors and give dishes a satisfying depth! For our side dish, we'll be cooking rice with sweet potato, an ingredient commonly eaten throughout Japan in autumn and winter. We'll also learn about how to use a versatile Japanese seasoning that has long been beloved as a drink, to help enhance the sweetness of other ingredients.</content>
