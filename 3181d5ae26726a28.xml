    <content>A gym in a residential area of Tokyo offers classes for a slightly unusual activity where going backward is actually a sign of progress - doing backflips. These lessons are becoming increasingly popular among children, housewives, and company employees who drop by to master their technique after work. Among the people at this gym are a man in his 40's who has long admired Jackie Chan and a young woman who hopes doing backflips might give her cosplay photos a stylish edge. For 3 days, we spoke to people determined to find out if doing a complete backflip will also help their lives take a turn for the better.</content>

    <content>Runners have 72 hours to complete a 400-km "Survival Run" around the main island of Okinawa Prefecture, southern Japan. The 68 participants from across Japan complain that the race is exhausting and torturous, yet they continue to push themselves, day and night. Some say that running allows them to forget all their worries and stress, others say they enjoy increasing their distance. We spent 3 days chasing after them to find out what motivates them to continue running.</content>

    <content>A store in Akihabara, Japan's biggest electronics town, sells over 100,000 electronics parts, including resistors, capacitors and circuit boards. Around 1,000 people come to the store every day, from professional engineers to people who like to build their own electronics for fun. Among the people we meet are a musician who makes his own effects units; a graduate student who makes drones to take a break from job hunting; and a man whose hobby of fixing car audio systems has turned into a job. For 3 days, we peeked inside the store to find out what it is people come to buy and what they hope to create with it.</content>

    <content>A road near Tokyo's Roppongi district is an oasis for taxi drivers who are allowed to park here for as long as they like. There, the drivers can relax, eat and even sleep on a break. As the coronavirus pandemic rumbles on, how do drivers feel about their jobs? The drivers we met included one who started this career after the pandemic erupted, one thinking of quitting because his income has plunged and another who cannot quit because he has a family to support. For 3 days, we asked drivers who parked along this road about their job and what the future holds.</content>
