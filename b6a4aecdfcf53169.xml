    <content>Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, is home to the Center for Disability Research and Capacity Development (DRD), an NGO led by Vo Thi Hoang Yen. As well as providing university scholarships and support for job-searching, Yen and her 13 staff are developing a digital map with detailed accessibility information for locations around Vietnam. Many people in Vietnam believe that people with disabilities are being punished for transgressions in a past life, leaving them marginalized and unable to find work. By encouraging Vietnam's disabled population to become independent, Yen and the DRD are looking to change Vietnam's attitude towards disability.</content>

    <content>The Altai mountains in western Mongolia are home to many folk music traditions. Although traditional Mongolian arts have been swept away by modernization in many regions, this area has carefully maintained them as part of a nomadic lifestyle. From the world-famous Khoomei throat singing to the ikhel, from which all Mongolian string instruments are said to have evolved, this region is a historic treasure trove of the musical arts. 12 years ago, a 1,300-year-old wooden instrument was discovered in a cave burial in the region, with markings that prove the long association between local nomads and music. Discover how locals are keeping ancient arts alive today and continuing to worship nature through song and music.</content>
