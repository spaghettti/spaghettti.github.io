However, they hit a major setback when a show was halted by the police, after which almost no theater would consent to renting them space. Now the group pushes on to find a new place in their home city, where they work to increase understanding and empathy among both loyal fans and new audience members.</content>

    <content>Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, is home to the Center for Disability Research and Capacity Development (DRD), an NGO led by Vo Thi Hoang Yen. As well as providing university scholarships and support for job-searching, Yen and her 13 staff are developing a digital map with detailed accessibility information for locations around Vietnam. Many people in Vietnam believe that people with disabilities are being punished for transgressions in a past life, leaving them marginalized and unable to find work. By encouraging Vietnam's disabled population to become independent, Yen and the DRD are looking to change Vietnam's attitude towards disability.</content>

    <content>China's Yangtze River has seen a decline in species due to pollution and overfishing, which the government responded to with a ban on industrial fishing. Although intended to improve the local environment, this measure had the side effect of taking away the livelihoods of the fishermen living around the river. Now, desperately seeking the means to support their families, some of the fishermen have begun utilizing their knowledge through conservationist work to preserve vulnerable species such as the finless porpoises of the Yangtze River.</content>
    <description>Fishing is now banned in many parts of the Yangtze River due to overfishing and pollution. Many out-of-work fishermen are now trying to find new jobs in environmental preservation.</description>

    <content>In recent years, Hong Kong has seen an increase in demonstrations such as the Umbrella Movement, which protests the degree of control China wields over the region. Many of those involved in the movements or simply seeking a better way of life have chosen to relocate to Taiwan, which can protect their human rights with a democratic government. Despite their pride as Hongkongers, the new immigrants leave careers behind to hopefully gain freedom that will extend to their children's generation.</content>
    <description>Since the 2014 Umbrella Movement, Hong Kong residents have increasingly been immigrating to Taiwan to seek freedom. This episode follows how several families perceive their former and current home.</description>

    <content>As bookstores around the world continue to dwindle in number among declining sales of physical books, Taiwan has been hit particularly hard: In 2012, two-thirds of all regions there lacked bookstores. But thanks to a government policy promoting small retailers, so-called "community bookstores" have begun to sprout up. Some include literary salons or cafes, while other have special concepts like trading local produce for books. All are places where paper books bring about new communication between people.</content>
    <description>Community bookstores offering unique non-book services like cooking and organic crops are gaining popularity in Taiwan as e-books and online sales have led to bankruptcy of traditional bookshops.</description>

    <content>Surabaya, a city in Indonesia, runs a bus service that doesn't cost money to use. Instead, the fare is paid in plastic bottles. The goal is to promote waste reduction and recycling. 20 years ago, the city streets were overflowing with garbage, so the local government took action. They introduced a system to transform everyday kitchen waste into compost. They set up waste banks, where people can sell recyclables. We take a look at the incredible success of Surabaya's eco-friendly initiatives.</content>

    <content>Indonesia has lost around 30% of its forest coverage in the last 50 years, in part due to illegal logging. Since 2004, environmental NGO Telapak has worked with rainforest residents to curb this destruction. Locals have set up cooperatives to manage, fell and sell their own trees as part of a community logging initiative, providing a stable income that's higher than what illegal logging can pay. There are now 10 cooperatives around Indonesia totaling 7,000 members. We visit a 1,500-strong cooperative in central Java to discover how local forestry initiatives are helping residents protect the environment and earn a living.</content>

    <content>The Altai mountains in western Mongolia are home to many folk music traditions. Although traditional Mongolian arts have been swept away by modernization in many regions, this area has carefully maintained them as part of a nomadic lifestyle. From the world-famous Khoomei throat singing to the ikhel, from which all Mongolian string instruments are said to have evolved, this region is a historic treasure trove of the musical arts. 12 years ago, a 1,300-year-old wooden instrument was discovered in a cave burial in the region, with markings that prove the long association between local nomads and music. Discover how locals are keeping ancient arts alive today and continuing to worship nature through song and music.</content>

    <content>In November 2020, one of Thailand's biggest festivals, the Surin Elephant Round-Up, took place -- despite the coronavirus pandemic. The event went ahead thanks largely to the passion of an ethnic tribe of elephant handlers. With a history of living with elephants that dates back centuries, the Kui people today depend heavily on income from tourism -- a livelihood that is now in danger of disappearing. We follow the people taking on new challenges in a long-running fight to preserve their culture.</content>

    <content>The Nam Theun 2 Dam sits atop the Nakai Plateau in eastern Laos. Most of the power it produces is sold to Thailand, but a percentage of profits is earmarked for nature conservation and for improving the lives of locals. The region is a treasure trove of plant and animal life, so the government has forbidden locals from hunting or logging. Those who have lost their livelihoods are now pinning their hopes on an income from eco-tourism. The residents of one village have had their lives turned upside down by the mega-dam. What can be done to both conserve the environment and improve locals' quality of life?</content>
    <description>Almost all of the power produced by the Nam Theun 2 Dam in Laos is sold to Thailand. Some of the profit goes towards conservation and facilities for locals. But are locals really benefitting?</description>
