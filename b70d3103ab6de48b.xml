    <content>When a Japanese tea ceremony master with a connection to Itsuki's late mother shows up, the family goes on a journey that takes in a busy work schedule, missed dance recitals and a bizarre English afternoon tea party! Throughout it all, the Japanese phrase "Ichi-go Ichi-e" keeps popping up, which Bryan is told means "once in a lifetime." When the family finally slows down enough to appreciate a quiet moment, he realizes that it has a far deeper meaning than he first thought.</content>
