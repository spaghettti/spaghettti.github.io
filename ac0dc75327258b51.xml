    <content>We follow Imoto Haruhisa, a 50-year-old maths teacher so famous people come from across the nation to observe his classroom. From a top-level school to a foster care facility, he encourages students to shine in classes praised as "magical" and "miraculous." His unorthodox lessons never use textbooks or require taking notes. How does this approach help students build their thinking skills? Through Imoto's "ultimate philosophy of learning," we find many hints applicable not only in education, but for raising children and personnel development as well.</content>

    <content>We spent several months following plant breeder Washizawa Koji, known as "The God of Dahlias." In his dahlia garden on the outskirts of Akita City, he's created innovative new varieties of dahlia that have shaken up the flower industry. Once considered plain, the dahlia has become a bright flower, popular for special occasions thanks to Washizawa's efforts. Though he spends his days walking the fields barefoot and sleeping in a hut nearby, he has led an incredible life. In his devotion to dahlias, he ended up sacrificing his family; now, his thoughts once again turn to them. This is the story of a man enthralled by the magic of dahlias, and the family that was torn apart.</content>

    <content>At Japan's department stores, no event is more popular than the Hokkaido Products Fair. And the charismatic man behind the scenes is Honda Daisuke. As the industry's only Hokkaido-based buyer, he taps into his extensive network of contacts to discover food and ingredients that surprise and delight customers all over the country. What's more, he teams up with chefs and other food experts to turn those ingredients into original products, from sweets to sushi bowls. For the last few years Hokkaido's catches of winter salmon and crab have been declining. We follow Honda as he attempts to use a certain fish to create a new hit item for the fair. In 2020, he returns to Hokkaido Prefecture, which is struggling with earthquake recovery as well as poor fishing catches, to find new ways to promote the area.</content>
