Takamatsu City had been reduced to ruins because of repeated air bombings during World War II. The governor launched a huge project of constructing a new building for the prefectural government office that would serve as a symbol of not only post-war reconstruction but also democracy.

In its heyday, the mine produced 40 percent of all of Japan’s copper and nearly 40,000 people lived in the area. Although mining brought prosperity, it also created massive pollution: Ashio became infamous as the site of the country’s first major pollution disaster. Sulfur dioxide gas from the refining process killed off the surrounding forests. And huge amounts of toxic chemicals were carried downstream to the lowlands by the Watarase River. Potter Euan Craig grew up in Bendigo, southeastern Australia, a community that also suffered from the effects of mining pollution. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Euan travels to Ashio to see for himself how people have brought life back to the mountains, thanks to a massive reforestation program.
