      "content": "A gym in a residential area of Tokyo offers classes for a slightly unusual activity where going backward is actually a sign of progress - doing backflips. These lessons are becoming increasingly popular among children, housewives, and company employees who drop by to master their technique after work. Among the people at this gym are a man in his 40's who has long admired Jackie Chan and a young woman who hopes doing backflips might give her cosplay photos a stylish edge. For 3 days, we spoke to people determined to find out if doing a complete backflip will also help their lives take a turn for the better.",
