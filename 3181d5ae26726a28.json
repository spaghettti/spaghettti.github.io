At night, lights inside these seemingly countless tents give off a colorful glow. Among the campers is a group of coworkers who usually hit bars in the city but traveled all the way for a drinking-party with a difference, and a man who dreamed of sleeping in a tent with his young daughter. Each tent pitched on the rocky ground at an altitude of 2,300 meters is there for a unique reason. For 3 days, we spoke to the people seeking something \"a little different\" under the starry sky.",
