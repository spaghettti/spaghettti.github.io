Participants are sent food and drinks from the tour destination in advance and are able to enjoy them while listening to the tour conductor from the comfort of their homes.

Realizing that these virtual tours can allow clients to participate from anywhere in the world, the tour company has also created tours for clients in the United States in an effort to expand on what was once a completely domestic client base. This episode focuses on how the pandemic has forced a local tour company to shift its business model in order to survive.\n[In Depth: China Gives Agriculture Tech Boost]\nChina is gearing up to digitalize its agricultural industry to make farming more profitable.
