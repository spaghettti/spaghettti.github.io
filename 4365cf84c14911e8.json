Participants are sent food and drinks from the tour destination in advance and are able to enjoy them while listening to the tour conductor from the comfort of their homes. Another advantage these online tours offer clients is the lack of travel time between destinations. Realizing that these virtual tours can allow clients to participate from anywhere in the world, the tour company has also created tours for clients in the United States in an effort to expand on what was once a completely domestic client base. This episode focuses on how the pandemic has forced a local tour company to shift its business model in order to survive.\n[In Depth: China Gives Agriculture Tech Boost]\nChina is gearing up to digitalize its agricultural industry to make farming more profitable.

Recently, a company that operates 20 shipping container hotels in Japan's Kanto region has made many of its units available for use as portable \"rescue hotels\" that can be deployed almost anywhere in the country for use by rescue workers, medical staff, or for other relief services. An industrial equipment dealer also was similar potential in shipping containers and is now equipping them with solar-powered generators and high capacity batteries to create emergency response stations that can instantly provide local areas with a much needed boost to infrastructure during times of trouble. In this episode, we focus on how shipping containers can be used to bolster the Japan's emergency response capabilities.\n[In Depth: Japan Economy on Uncertain Path After GDP Bounce]\nJapan's economy had a record surge in the July to September quarter after taking a deep dive in the previous 3 months.

A hotel outside New Delhi is trying to make up for some of its lost business by offering guests something different -- a luxury suite on a bus that can take them anywhere without exposing them to anyone outside their social bubble. We catch a ride on the bus to see what the five-star hotel service looks like on wheels.",
