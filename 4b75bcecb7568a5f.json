We check in to see what progress is being made and also meet speed climbing specialist Ikeda Yudai, who helps us analyze the innovative technique of world champion sport climber Narasaki Tomoa.",

The effects of water resistance are particularly pronounced for breaststroke, meaning small adjustments can make a big difference. Down the decades Japanese swimmers have time and again set new standards for technique in the stroke. We meet Watanabe Ippei, the first man ever to record a sub-2m07s time in the 200m event, and assess his prospects for beating his formidable rivals on the world stage.",
