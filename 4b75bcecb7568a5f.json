Japan's climbers have traditionally been strong in bouldering and lead climbing, however, the advent of combined events that include speed climbing has prompted a concentrated effort to slash times. We check in to see what progress is being made and also meet speed climbing specialist Ikeda Yudai, who helps us analyze the innovative technique of world champion sport climber Narasaki Tomoa.",

      "content": "Breaststroke is a popular and easy to learn recreational swimming style, but when it comes to top-level competition it's actually considered one of the most technically challenging of all. The effects of water resistance are particularly pronounced for breaststroke, meaning small adjustments can make a big difference. Down the decades Japanese swimmers have time and again set new standards for technique in the stroke. We meet Watanabe Ippei, the first man ever to record a sub-2m07s time in the 200m event, and assess his prospects for beating his formidable rivals on the world stage.",

Using the wake created by a boat as a ramp, riders perform mind-boggling aerial tricks, twisting and turning with extreme creativity and style. 16-year-old Takamura Taiga is the current Japan Men's Champion, but is yet to make a serious breakthrough onto the world stage. Coached by his father on a lake at the foot of Mt. Fuji, we follow Taiga as he tries to land a highly advanced trick and see if he has what it takes to compete against the world's best.",

The \"Tsukahara\" would have a lasting impact on gymnastics, influencing countless techniques including the \"Kolman\" and the \"Cassina.\" In the 21st century, Japanese gymnasts such as Tomita Hiroyuki, Uchimura Kohei and most recently Miyachi Hidetaka, have taken the Tsukahara's key elements into fresh territory, pushing the boundaries of human potential in gymnastics on the way. We explore the rich legacy of this iconic move.",
