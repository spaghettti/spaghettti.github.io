      "content": "We explore speed climbing, a unique competitive discipline that sees 2 climbers race to the top of a standardized 15m wall. Japan's climbers have traditionally been strong in bouldering and lead climbing, however, the advent of combined events that include speed climbing has prompted a concentrated effort to slash times. We check in to see what progress is being made and also meet speed climbing specialist Ikeda Yudai, who helps us analyze the innovative technique of world champion sport climber Narasaki Tomoa.",

      "content": "Since its earliest iterations in the 1960's, wakeboarding has evolved into one of the fastest-growing water sports in the world. Using the wake created by a boat as a ramp, riders perform mind-boggling aerial tricks, twisting and turning with extreme creativity and style. 16-year-old Takamura Taiga is the current Japan Men's Champion, but is yet to make a serious breakthrough onto the world stage. Coached by his father on a lake at the foot of Mt. Fuji, we follow Taiga as he tries to land a highly advanced trick and see if he has what it takes to compete against the world's best.",

The \"Tsukahara\" would have a lasting impact on gymnastics, influencing countless techniques including the \"Kolman\" and the \"Cassina.\" In the 21st century, Japanese gymnasts such as Tomita Hiroyuki, Uchimura Kohei and most recently Miyachi Hidetaka, have taken the Tsukahara's key elements into fresh territory, pushing the boundaries of human potential in gymnastics on the way. We explore the rich legacy of this iconic move.",
