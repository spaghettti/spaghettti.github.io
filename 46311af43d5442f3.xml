    <content>In this episode, we answer a question from a viewer living in Russia, "Can you tell me what is happening with plastic waste in such a technologically advanced country?" Our reporter is Russian broadcast announcer Anastasia Monakova. Japan is advanced in separating and recycling trash, but it also produces a significant portion of the world's plastic waste. To reduce waste, shops started charging for plastic shopping bags in July. But the amount of plastic waste generated by households is increasing due to COVID-19. We visit Kamakura, which was the first city in Japan to make a "zero plastic waste" declaration. In addition, bioplastics are attracting attention as they are kind to nature and recyclable options. Some are made from plant-derived materials and some are decomposed by microorganisms. We visit the laboratory of Professor Iwata Tadahisa of the University of Tokyo, who is a leader in this field. We cover the professor's work at the forefront of bioplastic research.</content>
    <description>Plastic waste is a problem worldwide and Japan is one of the worst offenders. What is happening in Kamakura with its "zero plastic waste" policy? And what is the future of bioplastic?</description>

    <content>This time, we answer a question from carpet designer Abdelilah Boubchir, a resident of Algeria, who wants to know about Japanese carpet making and the history. Our reporter is Karima Elsamny, an Arabic broadcast announcer from Egypt. In Okayama Prefecture's Kurashiki area, local Igusa rush grass is used to produce Hanagoza mats and Igusa carpets called Kurashiki Dantsu. Both were once exported overseas. Made of dyed Igusa rush grass woven into patterns, Hanagoza mats were especially popular. Igusa can absorb moisture and thus be used in hot, humid Japanese summers. We explore the appeal of rugs and carpets designed for the climate of Japan.</content>
