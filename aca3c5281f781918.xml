    <content>Bashofu is a traditional Okinawan fabric, which originated about 600 years ago when the islands formed the independent Ryukyu Kingdom. The stalks of a species of banana plant are the source of the fibers, which are painstakingly knotted together into longer strands of thread. The knots are visible in the woven fabric. Bashofu is ideal for the local climate and is treasured by kimono buffs across Japan. This episode looks at some of the distinctive local Kasuri designs in which different colored fibers are used to create patterns and images in the fabric. We also introduce attempts to reproduce the fabric of the old kingdom from precious remaining samples.</content>
    <description>Bashofu is a fabric born in Okinawa with 600 years of history. The light and airy fabric is perfect for the hot and humid climate of the islands. Let us weave our way through its charms.</description>

    <content>This episode features fragrances that can immediately evoke spring. We focus on the lavish bouquets of a Paris-based floral artist that look and smell like a spring garden, as well as pretty art nouveau-style perfume bottles and the quest to produce unique fragrances that express the motions of this season. In Japan, where the appreciation of fragrances has developed into an art form, devotees rely on small fragrant pieces of wood to evoke the plum blossoms that appear in spring. The knack is sensing the plum blossoms without them actually being there. Various smells in the woods and mountains herald the arrival of spring, stirring memories of home, as well as stirring the appetite.</content>
    <description>The arrival of spring is always signaled by the fresh scents that waft from nature. This episode shines light on kodo, the Japanese art of recreating, appreciating and describing such fragrances.</description>

    <content>This episode features Bingata, the Okinawan dyed fabrics renowned for their vivid patterns and vibrant colors. We look at some examples, listed as national treasures, which recall the splendor and pomp of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Only royalty was granted the privilege of wearing one particular color. We look at the techniques for producing the vivid reds and the motifs inspired by the natural surroundings. After the devastating Battle of Okinawa in 1945, people resorted to some unexpected things for dyeing scarce fabrics. And we feature the tapestries fashioned by a 16th generation artisan committed to reviving Bingata. The 2019 fire which destroyed Shuri Castle, the seat of the Ryukyu Kingdom, has prompted the artisan to break new ground.</content>
    <description>Bingata, the Okinawan dyed fabric, has stayed relevant in its homeland for over 500 years. Its vivid colors and delicate patterns are manifestations of the beautiful climate and culture of Okinawa.</description>
