    <content>Japan is home to all kinds of libraries. The episode features some unique examples across the country, including some historic structuring giving a sense of the periods in which they were built, as well as some futuristic facilities. We visit a library resembling a spaceship amongst trees. Inside is a forest of books stretching for 200m. We look at a university library shaped like the Colosseum of Rome, a place where the intellect engages in combat. Wonder at the futuristic library designed by Shigeru Ban that looks like something out of a science-fiction film. And we look at the transformation of an old spinning mill and an old primary school, the former of brick construction and the latter built entirely from cypress wood, into reading spaces.</content>
    <description>The library offers much more than just books; it is a place that satisfies intellectual curiosity and one that enriches people's lives in many ways. Tune in for a chapter on the library.</description>

    <content>This episode takes us on a journey into some of the little known aspects of Shigaraki ware. This pottery was featured in the NHK morning drama series "Scarlet." Shigaraki jars, both of the narrow- and wide-mouthed kind, have been praised by devotees of the tea ceremony as espousing the aesthetics of "hie" (chill) and "kare" (wither). The best examples of Shigaraki ware are said to have been produced prior to circa 1700. They are distinguished by their firing techniques called "yaki-shime." Kawase Toshiro, a master of flower arrangement, produces some floral displays using antique Shigaraki vases. We look at the versatile nature of the clay used in Shigaraki ware that potters find so attractive, and also feature a Shigaraki-ware bath soothing to body and soul.</content>
    <description>The Shigaraki ware is pottery that originated in 13th century Japan. Its rustic appeal has long been adored by tea ceremony practitioners and everyday people alike for ages; tune in to find out why.</description>

    <content>Small things are always somehow enchanting. This episode explores the whimsy world of miniatures. We delve into the astonishing skill required to fashion a tiny bowl of noodles that can be perched on a finger. It looks just like the real thing, even down to the glistening noodles and soup. And we take a look at a range of tiny toys, which came about after the 18th century Shogun issued an edict against extravagance and luxury, as well as a witty health charm in the shape of a red owl. Emperor Napoleon was among those fascinated by miniature books - they resemble tiny works of art. We peek inside what appears to be just an ordinary wall socket to see what is causing such a sensation on social media. Also featured is miniature scenery in pots and tiny bonsai that give a soothing touch to any surroundings.</content>
    <description>From small toys, to recreations of epic scenery on a tray, miniature items have a powerful, timeless appeal. Join us for this episode as we shrink into the fascinating world of miniatures.</description>

    <content>This episode features staircases of the kind that somehow beckon people to ascend them. Architect Ando Tadao keenly describes his ideal stairs. A visit is made to some staircases highly recommended by fans. We take a look at a large theatrical set of stairs that has appeared in Tokyo's Kyobashi district. And we delve into the intricacies of the traditional-style stairs at the teahouse in Yokohama's Sankeien Garden and Nijojinya, which was the home of a rich merchant in Kyoto. Viewers can admire the beauty of the drawers and shelving that built into the stairs in the smaller townhouses of other Kyoto merchants to make effective use of the limited amount of space in the city. The craftsmen who fashioned such staircases had an eye for detail. We look at the skill that produced the beautiful curves in the wooden handrails and the clever way in which the stairs were organized to accommodate drawers and shelving.</content>
    <description>Stairways are very practical, but that's not all they are. At times, they can be exciting gateways that lead us into the unknown. Join us for a climb up the magnificent world of stairs.</description>

    <content>This episode features Wasarasa, or Japanese-style chintz. These printed fabrics originated in India, and subsequently evolved into unique styles in Japan. We take part in a tea ceremony performed by the Issa-an school of sencha tea ceremony that makes lavish use of chintz. And we look at the pattern sheets (more than 200 of them!) and the brushwork required for a premium-quality chintz kimono. We meet an up-and-coming artisan who is reviving 1,400-year-old designs. Also featured is the chintz supplied to the Nabeshima clan, which ruled over what is now Saga Prefecture. The techniques were kept secret and were only rediscovered again when certain texts came to light in the Showa period (1926-1989). We admire some woodblock-printed examples of the Nabeshima-style chintz produced by an artisan designated as a National Living Treasure.</content>
    <description>Wasarasa is Japanese dyed fabric inspired by Indian chintz, and often necessitates the use of many stencils. With its exotic look, it continues to charm, especially sencha tea ceremony practitioners.</description>

    <content>This episode features Japanese swords. We look at Chikakage, a sword of the 16th-century warlord Akechi Mitsuhide, which was discovered in 2019, and ponder what he might have thought about this weapon. We delve into the fascinating craftsmanship that goes into forging the ultimate sword. The Hon'ami Family has been polishing and sharpening swords since the Muromachi Period (1336-1573). The current head of the family, who has been designated as one of Japan's Living Treasures, shows us what this craft involves. An accomplished sword drawer shows off his swordsmanship and how the forms of swords have evolved over the ages. Also featured is a sword dating from the Heian Period (794-1185). Its scabbard, featuring the oldest extant feline motif in Japan, is a national treasure. A fictional swordsman and computer game character Mikazuki Munechika, who has taken his name from another well-known weapon, makes his appearance.</content>

Check patterns appear on pottery vessels and figures from Japan's pre-historic era, as well as in the prints of the ukiyo-e artist Toshusai Sharaku, who was active in the late 18th century. We take a look at some stylish black-checked glassware, as well as some examples of Kutani ware. The check patterns of the latter, made up of 3,500 tiny squares, appear to move. The grandson of the landscaper Shigemori Mirei (1896-1975) tells us about the check-pattern garden his grandfather designed for Tofuku-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture.

    <content>Urushi or Japanese lacquer combines beauty and utility. It has been recognized as an intangible cultural asset by UNESCO. The Joboji-machi district in Iwate Prefecture is a source for high-quality, domestically produced lacquer. It is a scarce commodity, accounting for only 2% of the lacquer used in Japan. According to the lacquer tappers, a drop of lacquer sap is as precious as a drop of human blood. The area is famous for the lacquerware bowls associated with the local Joboji Temple. Also featured are some lacquerware speakers. They look good and sound good too! We visit a house in Sabae, Fukui Prefecture being decorated with lacquered walls and floors, which are likely to take one hundred years to complete. We also take a look at the amazingly designed round lacquerware lunchboxes traditionally used by the timber merchants in the Owase area in Mie Prefecture. And we feature the conservation work on the lacquered surfaces of the Toshogu Shrine in Nikko, which has been ongoing since the complex was built in the Edo period.</content>
    <description>Lacquer,the oldest varnish in Japan, has long been used for a variety of items. It offers not only beautiful gloss, but also practical advantages. Come and experience the world of Japanese lacquer.</description>

    <content>This episode provides a behind-the-scenes look at maiko or the apprentice geisha of Kyoto's Gion district. We look at various aspects of their attire. Why, for example, do they only apply rouge to their bottom lip? Unlike geisha, maiko do not wear wigs; their elaborate hairstyle is done with their own hair. We see maiko undergoing an arduous dance lesson presided over by Inoue Yachiyo V, a master of dance and designated National Treasure. In the last 10 days of their apprenticeship, the maiko wear particular kimono and hairstyles and do special dances. We look at why they blacken their teeth. And we follow maiko on the final day of their apprenticeship when they take part in a ceremony to mark their transition to geisha.</content>
    <description>Maikos, or apprentice geishas, bestow elegance upon Kyoto. They wear traditional Japanese hairstyles and kimono as they train for years in performing arts to one day become professional entertainers.</description>
