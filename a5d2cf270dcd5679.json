      "content": "One of the immune system's important roles is to produce antibodies to neutralize pathogens. Japanese researchers found that the activity of immune cells called lymphocytes, which produce antibodies, is closely linked to the autonomic nervous system. A division of the ANS switches on and off, sending signals for the production of antibodies and their circulation around the body. We also focus on how to balance the ANS so that your immunity functions properly.",
