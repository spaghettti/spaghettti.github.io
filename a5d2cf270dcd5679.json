      "content": "One of the immune system's important roles is to produce antibodies to neutralize pathogens. Japanese researchers found that the activity of immune cells called lymphocytes, which produce antibodies, is closely linked to the autonomic nervous system. A division of the ANS switches on and off, sending signals for the production of antibodies and their circulation around the body. We also focus on how to balance the ANS so that your immunity functions properly.",
      "description": "Researchers recently discovered that the immune system, which protects the body from disease, is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. We focus on the latest discoveries on the ANS.",

      "content": "We focus on a hospital that accepted people from a cruise ship with a COVID-19 outbreak, which has since treated many seriously ill coronavirus patients. At first, little was known about the disease and how to treat it. The number of patients grew along with concerns that staff would become infected and unable to treat patients. The hospital introduced remote monitoring of patients and altered its layout to protect staff. We look at changes hospitals can make to keep functioning amid COVID-19.",

It has a low risk of side effects and can be used on infants and the elderly. Injected vaccines aim to stop an infection from worsening. They cannot prevent infection itself, but the nasal spray can. The nasal spray vaccine has completed all clinical trials and has the potential to be adapted for use against the new coronavirus.",

Much of the mechanism behind it remains a mystery, but in recent years attention has focused on inflammation that occurs in certain brain cells.

Studies are also being done on whether stress can be relieved through certain aromas.",

To this end, imaging software has been created that can detect the possibility of Alzheimer's using MRI images of the brain.",
