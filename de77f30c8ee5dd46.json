Bugs of all shapes and sizes have had to develop unique defensive strategies just to make it through the day. Some use color to advertise their venomous shield; others blend in by mimicking the natural environment. A few even resemble excrement to guard their privacy ... with great success! But none will capture your heart like a tiny yellow bug that smiles and dances!",

In the forests of Okutama, Hirano finds nature's drama always on display as he films the fall foliage and an array of wild animals. Bears and monkeys come down from the hills to feast on fruits in local villages. A species of bird actually encourages angry ants to attack and bite it over and over again. Look out!",

Environmental degradation and loss of habitat have led to a decline in these \"living fossils\" that have remained relatively unchanged in 170 million years. After heavy rains caused massive damage to one region's towns and rivers, a team of experts, assisted by local schoolchildren, launches a project to locate and return their amphibian neighbors that have been washed downstream.",
