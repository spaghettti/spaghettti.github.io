      "content": "Hundreds of thousands of insect species make their home in the jungles of Costa Rica. But it's a constant battle for survival. Bugs of all shapes and sizes have had to develop unique defensive strategies just to make it through the day. Some use color to advertise their venomous shield; others blend in by mimicking the natural environment. A few even resemble excrement to guard their privacy ... with great success! But none will capture your heart like a tiny yellow bug that smiles and dances!",

Environmental degradation and loss of habitat have led to a decline in these \"living fossils\" that have remained relatively unchanged in 170 million years. After heavy rains caused massive damage to one region's towns and rivers, a team of experts, assisted by local schoolchildren, launches a project to locate and return their amphibian neighbors that have been washed downstream.",

His courtship dance starts with a bow; the feathers extend into a tutu-like skirt while dancing on the tips of his toes. Ducking his black head onto iridescent breast feathers produces an eerie \"smiley face.\" The performance ends with a rhythmic shaking of the head from side to side. But the finicky female may still peck and reject!",

But those first at the kill scene best get their fill before the clan's alpha female arrives. She eats uncontested. Her role? Simply producing offspring.",
