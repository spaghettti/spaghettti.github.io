    <content>One of the immune system's important roles is to produce antibodies to neutralize pathogens. Japanese researchers found that the activity of immune cells called lymphocytes, which produce antibodies, is closely linked to the autonomic nervous system. A division of the ANS switches on and off, sending signals for the production of antibodies and their circulation around the body. We also focus on how to balance the ANS so that your immunity functions properly.</content>
    <description>Researchers recently discovered that the immune system, which protects the body from disease, is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. We focus on the latest discoveries on the ANS.</description>

    <content>Vaccines protect the body from infectious diseases. Despite the large number of pathogens that exist, only a few vaccines have been developed. Ensuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccines is very difficult. We look at the history of vaccines, as well as how they are made and how they prevent disease. The COVID-19 vaccine that's closest to completion is a new type. Experts offer their input on its safety and effectiveness.</content>
    <description>Vaccines for the novel coronavirus are being created around the world, with some in their final stage of development. We look at how valuable they might be.</description>

    <content>We focus on a hospital that accepted people from a cruise ship with a COVID-19 outbreak, which has since treated many seriously ill coronavirus patients. At first, little was known about the disease and how to treat it. The number of patients grew along with concerns that staff would become infected and unable to treat patients. The hospital introduced remote monitoring of patients and altered its layout to protect staff. We look at changes hospitals can make to keep functioning amid COVID-19.</content>
    <description>One of the biggest concerns medical institutions have is the possibility that staff could become infected with COVID-19. We look at the innovative ways one hospital has managed to avoid that.</description>

    <content>A new influenza vaccine developed in Japan is sprayed into the nose. It takes advantage of mucosal immunity in the nose and mouth to stop infection. It has a low risk of side effects and can be used on infants and the elderly. Injected vaccines aim to stop an infection from worsening. They cannot prevent infection itself, but the nasal spray can. The nasal spray vaccine has completed all clinical trials and has the potential to be adapted for use against the new coronavirus.</content>
    <description>As concerns rise about the overlap of COVID-19 with the winter influenza season, an innovative flu vaccine with few side effects has been developed in Japan and is expected to be put to practical use.</description>

    <content>Depression is a disorder in which chronic stress triggers an abnormality in the brain. Much of the mechanism behind it remains a mystery, but in recent years attention has focused on inflammation that occurs in certain brain cells. We look at why this inflammation occurs and how it causes depression, and hear from an expert who hopes to use this knowledge to create a new drug to treat depression. Studies are also being done on whether stress can be relieved through certain aromas.</content>
    <description>Since the coronavirus pandemic began, the number of people with depression has been increasing around the world. We focus on the disorder and the mechanism behind it, as well as the latest research.</description>

    <content>Atopic dermatitis patients suffer from an itch-scratch cycle in which itchiness leads to scratching, triggering inflammation that in turn causes skin damage, prompting even more itching. The condition is usually treated with steroids, but a Japanese dermatologist has developed a drug that stops the itching, breaking the cycle. We also introduce tips on how to prevent dry skin in winter.</content>
    <description>Atopic dermatitis is thought to affect over 200 million people worldwide. A drug awaiting approval is expected to break the condition's itch-scratch cycle, in which the immune system plays a role.</description>

    <content>Alzheimer's disease makes up almost 70% of dementia cases. No cure is available, but a vaccine against it is being developed in Japan. The key is the body's own immune system. The vaccine aims to harness it to remove amyloid-beta, which is thought to cause Alzheimer's. Efforts are also being made to detect the disease early on to slow its progression. To this end, imaging software has been created that can detect the possibility of Alzheimer's using MRI images of the brain.</content>

    <content>In May 2020, Japan's then-Prime Minister Abe Shinzo declared that the country had successfully contained coronavirus infections thanks to the "Japan Model." An independent committee published a report on this model, which combined a soft lockdown and anti-cluster measures to prevent the spread of infection and limit economic damage. The program focuses on the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, anti-cluster measures, PCR testing and the soft lockdown. We look at the lessons learned from it.</content>
    <description>In the first six months of the pandemic, Japan was able to keep its coronavirus infection and death rates lowest among G7 nations. We look at lessons learned that can be applied to other countries.</description>

    <content>Japanese researchers used a supercomputer to visualize how respiratory droplets spread in everyday situations including dining, office meetings and on public transportation such as taxis, trains and airplanes. They hope these visualizations will prevent people from being overly confident or fearful about COVID-19. One doctor is using such visualizations to prevent infections in home care and nursing facilities. He says such care plays a critical role amid the pandemic.</content>

    <content>An Egyptian doctor wrote to the program. He is currently in Japan studying a new medical technique called mechanotherapy, which treats scars and makes them virtually unnoticeable. It involves dispersing the force applied to scars considered difficult to treat, such as keloids. Efforts are also being made to help patients who have suffered psychological damage as a result of their scars by teaching them a special makeup method.</content>

    <content>Long COVID is a condition in which symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and hair loss continue after infection has passed. A Japanese researcher who studied the cause published a paper confirming that SARS-Cov-2 infects the brain. It says symptoms vary according to the area of the brain that is infected. Separately, a Japanese national medical institution has developed a blood test to predict who could get severe COVID-19.</content>

    <content>The gut flora, or gut microbiota, consists of 1,000 types of bacteria, totaling some 40 trillion organisms. The latest research shows long-distance runners have large amounts of a certain type of gut bacteria, which leads to higher athletic ability and less fatigue. A bacterial imbalance was found to negatively affect sleep quality and the immune system. We look at the effect of gut microbiota on health with a researcher who aims to develop lifestyle plans tailored to each person's gut environment.</content>

A Japanese doctor treats patients by combining antibiotics with fecal transplants using stool from siblings, achieving outstanding results. A clinical trial using gut microbiota is also under way for multiple sclerosis, which affects the central nervous system. A patient who needed a cane prior to the trial can now jog.</content>
