      "content": "The coronavirus has led to a rise in home dining. And as a result people are more concerned about what they put into their bodies. Amid this trend, produce from small scale farms is becoming increasingly popular. Consumers are able to buy fresh vegetables direct from farmers, via the Internet. And the products are often grown in a safer, more environmentally friendly way than those that are mass-produced. For farmers, the system not only offers greater profits, but the opportunity to make a contribution toward a sustainable future for society. We take a look at some examples in Japan.\nGuests:\nAkimoto Rina (Founder of a direct sales platform for produce)\nMiyata Hiroaki (Professor, Keio University)\nSekine Kae (Associate Professor, Aichi Gakuin University)\n*Today's Close-Up will continue to report on COVID-19.",

But a government push to bring workplace practices and administrative procedures fully into the digital era has put pressure on businesses and city authorities to eliminate the seals from most paperwork. We look at what the shift away from this long-running custom means for Japan, and some of the hurdles that are presenting themselves along the way.\nGuests:\nAtsugiri Jason (Tech firm executive/Comedian)\nWatanabe Yuichiro (Member of the Board, Japan In-House Lawyers Association)\nMiyata Hiroaki (Professor, Keio University)",

The government is aiming to have women in 30 percent of leadership roles by 2020, but the figure currently stands at just 14.8 percent. What does Japanese society need to do to change this? Overcoming \"unconscious bias\" might be the answer.
