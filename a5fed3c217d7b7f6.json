      "content": "The coronavirus has led to a rise in home dining. And as a result people are more concerned about what they put into their bodies. Amid this trend, produce from small scale farms is becoming increasingly popular. Consumers are able to buy fresh vegetables direct from farmers, via the Internet. And the products are often grown in a safer, more environmentally friendly way than those that are mass-produced. For farmers, the system not only offers greater profits, but the opportunity to make a contribution toward a sustainable future for society. We take a look at some examples in Japan.\nGuests:\nAkimoto Rina (Founder of a direct sales platform for produce)\nMiyata Hiroaki (Professor, Keio University)\nSekine Kae (Associate Professor, Aichi Gakuin University)\n*Today's Close-Up will continue to report on COVID-19.",
