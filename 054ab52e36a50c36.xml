    <content>This three-day, 360km trip takes us from lowland Gifu Prefecture and its blossoming cherry trees north into the snow-covered central mountains. We'll visit a traditional swordsmith to watch him forge katana blades from living flame, a hillside town built on water and some of Japan's most iconic thatched-roof homes. A final adventure involves our cyclist in a 200-year old tradition of amateur village kabuki, one of the many ways people have found to enjoy life in the remote mountains.</content>
    <description>Join us on a trip to Gifu, located near the center of Japan's main island, and experience its blossoming cherry trees, its snow-covered central mountains, and its inspiring people and traditions.</description>

    <content>Our ironman cyclist Michael sets off from Osaka. Leaving the giant city, he tackles the challenge of Japan's steepest road on his way to historic Nara Prefecture, site of the capital 1,300 years ago. As he rides through this tranquil countryside, he dives into a world of myth -- from Nara's sacred forest, brilliant with the colors of fall, he travels south to a land teeming with prehistoric burial mounds. Here, where ancient rulers slept for millennia, the old wisdom still shows us how to live in harmony with nature.</content>

    <content>Facing the Seto Inland Sea, sunny Kagawa Prefecture historically overcame a lack of natural resources and water through skill and hard work. Despite no local bamboo or paper, Kagawa artisans created paper fans famed for their quality. We get a look at how those fans are made. Then, after sampling Wasanbon sweets, prized for centuries for their delicate sweetness, we cross to a small island to sample soy sauce made the traditional way. A trip of tough but rewarding climbs, reflecting the spirit of Kagawa.</content>
    <description>A ride from one edge to the other of Japan's smallest prefecture, where a relative scarcity of natural resources has been historically offset by an unrelenting drive to create outstanding quality.</description>
