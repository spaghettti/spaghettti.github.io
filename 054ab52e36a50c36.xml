    <content>If you're a thrill seeker, we recommend the steep roads of Aizu, in the Fukushima mountains. Our cyclist heads deep into the woods where autumn colors decorate the forest. He finds a village stuck in time where locals gladly share their traditions. He learns about a style of hand weaving called, Karamushi and explores 300-year-old storehouses where sake is brewed. We'll also be exposed to an education system from the samurai era for girls that remains unchanged. This 300km ride provides a glimpse into the lives of proud locals with a resilient culture.</content>

    <content>Our ironman cyclist Michael sets off from Osaka. Leaving the giant city, he tackles the challenge of Japan's steepest road on his way to historic Nara Prefecture, site of the capital 1,300 years ago. As he rides through this tranquil countryside, he dives into a world of myth -- from Nara's sacred forest, brilliant with the colors of fall, he travels south to a land teeming with prehistoric burial mounds. Here, where ancient rulers slept for millennia, the old wisdom still shows us how to live in harmony with nature.</content>
