    <content>[On-Site Report]
An online bus tour started by a small bus tour company in western Japan is growing in popularity. Participants are sent food and drinks from the tour destination in advance and are able to enjoy them while listening to the tour conductor from the comfort of their homes. Another advantage these online tours offer clients is the lack of travel time between destinations. Realizing that these virtual tours can allow clients to participate from anywhere in the world, the tour company has also created tours for clients in the United States in an effort to expand on what was once a completely domestic client base. This episode focuses on how the pandemic has forced a local tour company to shift its business model in order to survive.

Strong, portable and weather resistant, shipping containers are becoming a popular choice in modern architecture. Recently, a company that operates 20 shipping container hotels in Japan's Kanto region has made many of its units available for use as portable "rescue hotels" that can be deployed almost anywhere in the country for use by rescue workers, medical staff, or for other relief services. An industrial equipment dealer also was similar potential in shipping containers and is now equipping them with solar-powered generators and high capacity batteries to create emergency response stations that can instantly provide local areas with a much needed boost to infrastructure during times of trouble. In this episode, we focus on how shipping containers can be used to bolster the Japan's emergency response capabilities.

This week's episode gives you an inside look at 2 companies that are combining modern technology with personal experience in order to create custom-made products for their disabled clients. One company, with a large number of disabled staff, is creating custom-built vehicles for people with disabilities.

A small start-up is also using a similar approach to create "powered prosthetics." These new prosthetics use sensors and motors to assist users with movement. The CEO and lead developer, an amputee himself, has spent the last 5 years developing a powered prosthetic leg and is aiming to have it ready for market in 2021.
