    <content>The male Lawe's Parotia could make any ballerina blush. That ultra-black tuxedo-like plumage is known to absorb 99% of light, making him the blackest bird on earth. His courtship dance starts with a bow; the feathers extend into a tutu-like skirt while dancing on the tips of his toes. Ducking his black head onto iridescent breast feathers produces an eerie "smiley face." The performance ends with a rhythmic shaking of the head from side to side. But the finicky female may still peck and reject!</content>
    <description>The male Lawe's parotia is quite the catch with its ultra-black plumage, romantic courting dance and spotless performance stage. But the finicky female will peck and reject for the slightest offense.</description>
