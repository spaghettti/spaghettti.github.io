    <content>Hundreds of thousands of insect species make their home in the jungles of Costa Rica. But it's a constant battle for survival. Bugs of all shapes and sizes have had to develop unique defensive strategies just to make it through the day. Some use color to advertise their venomous shield; others blend in by mimicking the natural environment. A few even resemble excrement to guard their privacy ... with great success! But none will capture your heart like a tiny yellow bug that smiles and dances!</content>
    <description>Survival is the name of the game in the insect kingdom of Costa Rica. Some use color to stand out; others resemble excrement to blend in. But all will woo you with their clever defensive strategies!</description>

    <content>Wildlife cinematographer Nobuaki Hirano is called to the outskirts of Tokyo to investigate a strange autumn occurrence: hornet nests are being attacked and plundered. But by what? In the forests of Okutama, Hirano finds nature's drama always on display as he films the fall foliage and an array of wild animals. Bears and monkeys come down from the hills to feast on fruits in local villages. A species of bird actually encourages angry ants to attack and bite it over and over again. Look out!</content>
    <description>Tokyo's got a secret. In fall, wild animals on the outskirts do odd things. Bears eat persimmons in public. Birds are happily covered in angry ants. And who knows what is targeting hornets! Look out!</description>

    <content>The Berenty Reserve in Madagascar off the east coast of Africa is famous for its cutest and most popular resident, the ring-tailed lemur. These primitive primates form troops featuring an intricate social system. We followed 2 mothers who were expelled from their group and observed their shared commitment through thick and thin to their friendship and each other's young. It's a tale of perseverance, tragedy and redemption as they carve out a slice of territory between 2 hostile lemur troops.</content>

    <content>Reaching 1.5 meters in length, the Japanese giant salamander will need more than its size to battle daunting odds. Environmental degradation and loss of habitat have led to a decline in these "living fossils" that have remained relatively unchanged in 170 million years. After heavy rains caused massive damage to one region's towns and rivers, a team of experts, assisted by local schoolchildren, launches a project to locate and return their amphibian neighbors that have been washed downstream.</content>

    <content>The male Lawe's Parotia could make any ballerina blush. That ultra-black tuxedo-like plumage is known to absorb 99% of light, making him the blackest bird on earth. His courtship dance starts with a bow; the feathers extend into a tutu-like skirt while dancing on the tips of his toes. Ducking his black head onto iridescent breast feathers produces an eerie "smiley face." The performance ends with a rhythmic shaking of the head from side to side. But the finicky female may still peck and reject!</content>

    <content>Dirty scavenger? Laughing opportunist? Oh, that's all a misunderstanding! The hyena clan is a marvel to behold. School starts early: just a few weeks after birth. The young are introduced to a strict matriarchal hierarchy where dissent is rare and males hardly register. Teamwork is an important subject for patrolling borders and stalking prey. But those first at the kill scene best get their fill before the clan's alpha female arrives. She eats uncontested. Her role? Simply producing offspring.</content>

    <content>Life's adventures begin early for Mandarin ducklings in the big city. They must heed mother's beckoning right after they're born, leaping from the tree hollow that serves as their nest or risk being left behind. Then it's off to the nearest pond where they'll stay until adulthood. But the journey is fraught with danger. Predators such as crows watch their every move. Falling through the "quacks" of curbside drains is just one of many man-made hazards ahead for these adorable "sitting ducklings"!</content>

    <content>Gars aren't big on activity but don't think they're being lazy. Whether hunting or breeding, they calmly wait for the ideal time. Gars are not good swimmers so they lie still, relying on their alligator-like snout with sharp teeth to ambush unsuspecting prey. And who needs annual spawning when the lifespan can reach 90 years of age? They even come to the surface occasionally to breathe air! This amazing way of life has allowed the species to survive relatively unchanged for 100 million years.</content>

    <content>Legend has it that a powerful "man-beast" inhabits the cloud forests of Ecuador. Undaunted, the Darwin team traversed rugged terrain pursuing this mythological figure. What we found was hardly mysterious: an agile bear species whose playful cubs frolic in the treetops. Mothers raise their young on steep hillsides to maintain a careful distance from overly-aggressive males. She also decides when her cub must strike out on its own. We were fortunate to witness this cruel yet inevitable separation.</content>

They attend a range of classes to learn hunting, parenting and dealing with rivals. Female students show initiative, while the boys mostly lie around. In response, some of the instructors dole out a range of punishments including scoldings ... and expulsions! Find out what it means to "get schooled" in the "mane" subject!</content>

    <content>The Bay of Fundy features the world's largest tidal range of up to 16 meters. Huge mudflats lie exposed, attracting millions of semipalmated sandpipers during their summer migration that feast on the plentiful mud shrimps and worms. Their presence, in turn, attracts peregrine falcons looking for an easy meal. Cormorants dive amid the strong currents for small fish, only to find seagulls lurking on the surface, ready to steal their catch. These stomping and chomping grounds are a sight to behold.</content>
