    <content>At the center of Naha City lies Kokusai Street, a symbol of modern Okinawa Prefecture as it was one of the first areas to reemerge after the grueling battles of the war. Stretching for 1.6km, the street was in fact once called "The Miracle Mile." Originally a black market bordering the American-occupied zone, it became Okinawa's busiest shopping street, with 500 souvenir shops and restaurants. This episode focuses on the street's history and source of its prosperity: the diversity and dynamism of Okinawa.</content>

    <content>The people of Tohoku have carved out their livelihoods, quietly enduring frigid, harsh winters. This is doubtlessly because the promise of spring awaits. The winter is the time spent waiting patiently for spring. They wait for the blocked roads to reappear. They wait for the melted snow to glisten. They wait for the flowers to go into full bloom and for the birds and insects to come dancing out for nectar. With these signals, the people begin their daily routines to live. We give thanks for the long-awaited season of warm water, are gladdened by the blooming flowers, and tour spring in Tohoku.</content>

    <content>Kirishima, a group of 20 mountains in the south of Kyushu. It is a volcanic area that was a central location in Japan's creation myth. Its name, meaning "fog island," refers to the way that the peaks look like an island rising above the clouds. Its high rate of rainfall creates springs and hot springs for the towns around it, and the volcanic ash it releases helps grow sweet potatoes that have fostered a shochu alcohol culture. As they receive the bounty of the mountains, the people there have created their own unique customs, and carved out their own way of living in harmony with an unforgiving environment. An old mountain guide struggles with volcanic ash as he seeks to reopen the area for tourism and mountain climbing. The people here's love for the region has no limits. Even though there are few jobs for the younger generation, they don't want to leave, and even those who do tend to come back. We will show you the strong, dynamic lifestyle of the people who live together with the Kirishima peaks.</content>

    <content>The Sanriku Railway in Iwate Prefecture is a lifeline, playing an important role in the local community. The train goes up and down the line, and the arrival of the train is part of the rhythm of life. In March 2011, the railway was completely destroyed by the tsunami that followed the Great East Japan Earthquake. The road to recovery was a difficult one, and at one point, there was even talk of abolishing the line. The railway is now back on track, having finally resumed full service. We look back on the slow but steady restoration of the Sanriku Railway, over a period of 3 years.</content>
