    <content>At the center of Naha City lies Kokusai Street, a symbol of modern Okinawa Prefecture as it was one of the first areas to reemerge after the grueling battles of the war. Stretching for 1.6km, the street was in fact once called "The Miracle Mile." Originally a black market bordering the American-occupied zone, it became Okinawa's busiest shopping street, with 500 souvenir shops and restaurants. This episode focuses on the street's history and source of its prosperity: the diversity and dynamism of Okinawa.</content>

    <content>Kirishima, a group of 20 mountains in the south of Kyushu. It is a volcanic area that was a central location in Japan's creation myth. Its name, meaning "fog island," refers to the way that the peaks look like an island rising above the clouds. Its high rate of rainfall creates springs and hot springs for the towns around it, and the volcanic ash it releases helps grow sweet potatoes that have fostered a shochu alcohol culture. As they receive the bounty of the mountains, the people there have created their own unique customs, and carved out their own way of living in harmony with an unforgiving environment. An old mountain guide struggles with volcanic ash as he seeks to reopen the area for tourism and mountain climbing. The people here's love for the region has no limits. Even though there are few jobs for the younger generation, they don't want to leave, and even those who do tend to come back. We will show you the strong, dynamic lifestyle of the people who live together with the Kirishima peaks.</content>

    <content>1,200 years ago, Kukai, a well-known Japanese monk, made a pilgrimage through 88 sacred sites in the Japanese island of Shikoku. The route through all 88 sites is 1,400 kilometers long and loops around the island. Pilgrim's still come, with both anxiety and hope, to follow in Kukai's footsteps. Kukai told his followers that enlightenment knows one's own heart. The Shikoku Pilgrimage is a journey to find oneself, shedding one's spiritual baggage simply by walking. The pilgrim's journey around Shikoku brings unexpected encounters and lifelong memories.</content>

    <content>Located in the mountains of Gifu Prefecture, Shirakawa-go is a village full of old-fashioned houses with thatched roofs - and a registered World Heritage Site. The roofs are steeply slanted, products of a building technique called Gassho-zukuri, which was born of the knowledge built up by surviving in an extraordinarily snowy region. The scenery in the 300-year-old town hasn't changed. Even now, time moves slowly. This is the story of the villagers of Shirakawa-go living hand-in-hand.</content>

    <content>Japanese people have a long history of eating tofu, a filling food that always goes well with a drink. It is made simply by grinding and cooking soybeans, before extracting and solidifying the soymilk.

In an area of heavy winter snowfall, tofu plays an important part in an annual religious ceremony. We explore the secrets of tofu from across the islands of Japan.</content>

    <content>Soba noodles made from buckwheat flour have been a part of the Japanese diet even longer than rice. Today, we will take a journey across Japan to sample soba. In the past, soba repeatedly saved people from starvation as buckwheat grows in poor soil and can be harvested in just 75 days. Soba has long remained a familiar part of Japanese cuisine and culture. Even if you're low on cash, or having trouble getting along with others, a simple bowl of soba can help you feel better.</content>
