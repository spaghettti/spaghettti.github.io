    <content>This time, we meet American-born Pamela Ann Matsunaga who's traveled the world with her 5 children, spending several years in Greece to finally settle down in sunny Okinawa Prefecture. Although the pandemic has forced her to close down her previous business, a restaurant, she stays positive in her new passion: making award-winning Greek-style cheese with Okinawan goat milk. We also visit Mouhamadou Dieng from Senegal, who deals in used tires he carefully chooses and exports from Japan to the world.</content>

    <content>On this episode, we travel to Urakawa Town in Hokkaido Prefecture where Nguyen Van Bao and Nguyen Van Hieu, 2 veterinarians from Vietnam, work as grooms at a racehorse breeding farm. Not accustomed to taking care of horses at first, they're now in charge of 20 animals each. We follow them as they tackle the busiest time of the year for horse breeders: spring, when mothers give birth. We also meet French-born Jeremy Escudero, who sells kitchen knives at a Tokyo store with more than a hundred years of history.</content>
