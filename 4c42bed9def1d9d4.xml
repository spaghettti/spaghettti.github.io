    <content>This time, we meet American-born Pamela Ann Matsunaga who's traveled the world with her 5 children, spending several years in Greece to finally settle down in sunny Okinawa Prefecture. Although the pandemic has forced her to close down her previous business, a restaurant, she stays positive in her new passion: making award-winning Greek-style cheese with Okinawan goat milk. We also visit Mouhamadou Dieng from Senegal, who deals in used tires he carefully chooses and exports from Japan to the world.</content>
