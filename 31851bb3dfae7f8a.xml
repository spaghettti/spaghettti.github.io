Every autumn, its so-called "Pear Street" fills up with farmers hawking their wares. Those farmers have thought up clever ways to make large, sweet pears, like growing branches across horizontal trellises that match the farmer's height. That lets the pears get plenty of sunlight and makes harvesting easier. Join us as we bite into Japan's world of pears!</content>

    <content>In Japan, peanuts are often eaten as-is, without flavoring or processing. That's because consumers want to taste the peanuts' own sweet, aromatic flavor. This time, we visit Japan's largest peanut production area, Chiba Prefecture, and learn about a traditional, machine-free drying method that gets the most sweetness out of the peanuts. We also sample a variety of local peanut dishes, meet scientists who spend some 15 years perfecting each new variety, and even try peanut ramen! (Reporter: Jason Hancock)</content>
