    <content>Our focus today is hijiki, a variety of seaweed that has been consumed in Japan for over 1,000 years.

Hijiki grow quickly at the start of spring on rocky coastlines, and are only available for harvest for a few days.

    <content>Japanese pears are large, round, juicy and have a great crunch. Chiba Prefecture, which neighbors Tokyo, is known as Japan's largest pear producer. Every autumn, its so-called "Pear Street" fills up with farmers hawking their wares. Those farmers have thought up clever ways to make large, sweet pears, like growing branches across horizontal trellises that match the farmer's height. That lets the pears get plenty of sunlight and makes harvesting easier. Join us as we bite into Japan's world of pears!</content>

We also sample a variety of local peanut dishes, meet scientists who spend some 15 years perfecting each new variety, and even try peanut ramen! (Reporter: Jason Hancock)</content>

    <content>Azuki beans are often sweetened, simmered and used in Japanese sweets. Their red color is said to ward off evil, and they're key at celebrations too. We visit an area in Hyogo Prefecture known for growing high-quality Azuki, and learn how artisans in Kyoto Prefecture put their skills to work making beautiful sweets that incorporate the beans. Learn all about Azuki beans, grown, eaten and beloved for over 5,000 years in Japan. (Reporter: Saskia Thoelen)</content>

    <content>Our focus today is fugu, or pufferfish. As one of Japan's great winter delicacies, it is eaten as nearly-transparent slices of sashimi, or in umami-packed hot pots. Even in seafood-loving Japan, fugu is a special treat that is among the most expensive fish. It's also known for containing lethal amounts of poison, requiring chefs to obtain a special license in order to prepare it. Dive in to learn more about the various methods devised to provide quality flavor while also ensuring safety. (Reporter: Kyle Card)</content>

    <content>Daikon, Japanese radishes, are often over 30cm long, large and white, but there are also colorful types ranging from pink to green. They're an essential ingredient used in stews, salads, miso soup and more. We visit the Miura Peninsula, where half the daikon eaten in the Tokyo region are grown. There, we discover a "curtain" of thousands of daikon drying on a beach, soil supplemented with ground tuna, and the skills of those involved in daikon production. (Reporter: Jason Hancock)</content>
