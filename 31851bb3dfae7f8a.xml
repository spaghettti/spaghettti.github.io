    <content>In Japan, peanuts are often eaten as-is, without flavoring or processing. That's because consumers want to taste the peanuts' own sweet, aromatic flavor. This time, we visit Japan's largest peanut production area, Chiba Prefecture, and learn about a traditional, machine-free drying method that gets the most sweetness out of the peanuts. We also sample a variety of local peanut dishes, meet scientists who spend some 15 years perfecting each new variety, and even try peanut ramen! (Reporter: Jason Hancock)</content>
