She's too busy balancing work and raising her kids to sit down and enjoy lunch. During her lunch break, she runs home while she eats, and once at her house, she does the laundry, cleans, and preps dinner before running back to her office again.\nIn another segment, we visit the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa to meet a public health nurse who has a surprising lunch of her own.",

Fresh fish is ground down to paste at 5 in the morning, and the product is shipped out in the evening. As the workers start so early, lunchtime comes at around 8. We look at the bento lunches of the fishcake makers.",

They stand by at all times, ready to provide emergency care to patients in remote areas.

When it comes to lunch, they eat when they can, but as soon as that call comes in, they jump right back into action.",

However, he does have a lot of experience as a mountaineer, and that's what landed him the job. And it's okay that he's not the most experienced chef, because he is armed with recipes written by his beloved wife. Plus, if even that is not enough, he can always call her to ask for emergency cooking advice!",
