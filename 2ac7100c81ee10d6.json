She's too busy balancing work and raising her kids to sit down and enjoy lunch. During her lunch break, she runs home while she eats, and once at her house, she does the laundry, cleans, and preps dinner before running back to her office again.\nIn another segment, we visit the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa to meet a public health nurse who has a surprising lunch of her own.",

Fresh fish is ground down to paste at 5 in the morning, and the product is shipped out in the evening. As the workers start so early, lunchtime comes at around 8. We look at the bento lunches of the fishcake makers.",
