Most years it's a time when Muslims fast during the day, joining friends and relatives after sunset to share a meal. However, self-isolation made it impossible. For another example, Bangladeshi community in Japan made up a network to help with each other.

Japan is advanced in separating and recycling trash, but it also produces a significant portion of the world's plastic waste. To reduce waste, shops started charging for plastic shopping bags in July. But the amount of plastic waste generated by households is increasing due to COVID-19. We visit Kamakura, which was the first city in Japan to make a \"zero plastic waste\" declaration. In addition, bioplastics are attracting attention as they are kind to nature and recyclable options. Some are made from plant-derived materials and some are decomposed by microorganisms. We visit the laboratory of Professor Iwata Tadahisa of the University of Tokyo, who is a leader in this field. We cover the professor's work at the forefront of bioplastic research.",
