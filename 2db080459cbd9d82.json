Getting up to use the toilet several times a night can disrupt your sleep and even lead to depression or serious injury. Many people think nocturia is an inevitable part of getting old, but we now know that most cases have a specific cause: the water you consume during the day is being stored up in a certain part of your body ... and it's not your bladder. However, with some easy methods anyone can do, you can reduce your nocturia!",

      "content": "It is estimated that 1 in 6 people in Japan suffer from dry eye. Your eyes become uncomfortable, itchy and painful, making it hard to concentrate on your work ... or do to work at all for very long. Typically, tears cover and protect the cornea, the important surface layer of the eye that sits over the iris and pupil. But if your eyes are dry, your corneas can end up exposed, and ultimately damaged. And although dry eye often stems from a lack of tears, there is another possible cause! We cover the latest dry eye research, and offer techniques to remedy dry eye that you can try at home!",
