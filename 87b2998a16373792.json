In the Edo period that lasted from the 17th to the 19th century, Japan adopted a policy that severely limited contact with the rest of the world. During this time, modern science made its way into Japan through Nagasaki, the only gateway to Western countries. Take a tour around a museum in Nagasaki City and discover how science spread all over Japan through medicine. Also visit Nagasaki University where they carry on the spirit of the first Western style medical school in Japan. Find out the university's latest research including the development of new drugs using a supercomputer as well as their contributions to combat new infectious diseases around the world.",

In 2019, the traditional technique of making Airag was registered as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. It has since attracted worldwide attention with the growing awareness in health consciousness. While much about Airag-making still remains unknown, the traditional knowledge may disappear as more nomads move to the city. Professor Yuki Morinaga of Meiji University has been investigating and recording the traditional method of Airag production for 8 years.
