In the Edo period that lasted from the 17th to the 19th century, Japan adopted a policy that severely limited contact with the rest of the world. During this time, modern science made its way into Japan through Nagasaki, the only gateway to Western countries. Take a tour around a museum in Nagasaki City and discover how science spread all over Japan through medicine. Also visit Nagasaki University where they carry on the spirit of the first Western style medical school in Japan. Find out the university's latest research including the development of new drugs using a supercomputer as well as their contributions to combat new infectious diseases around the world.",
