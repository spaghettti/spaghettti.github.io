The event went ahead thanks largely to the passion of an ethnic tribe of elephant handlers. With a history of living with elephants that dates back centuries, the Kui people today depend heavily on income from tourism -- a livelihood that is now in danger of disappearing. We follow the people taking on new challenges in a long-running fight to preserve their culture.",
