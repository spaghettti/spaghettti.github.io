    <content>The assassination of US President John F. Kennedy is still shrouded in mystery. With the help of top experts, NHK takes a new look at the incident through reenactments and fresh theories on the case.
Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed JFK, was once a US Marine stationed in Atsugi, Japan who later defected to the Soviet Union. While his own upbringing played a role in his decisions, there is also a possibility that a certain organization was manipulating him behind the scenes. The testimony of Oswald's wife, Marina, also reveals a failed assassination attempt by Oswald in the months leading up to Kennedy's death. We follow the little-known footprints left by this infamous assassin.</content>

    <content>6 months before JFK was killed, Lee Harvey Oswald attempted a separate assassination. Our coverage reveals the possibility that this attempt served as a focal point that linked Oswald to the JFK killing. The day of that killing, Oswald brought a rifle into a Dallas building. The US government report says 3 shots from that building killed JFK, but we take a new look at witness testimony and speak to 66 prominent campaigners to ask: was the assassination really the work of a "lone wolf"?</content>

    <content>Hokkaido Prefecture's Shiretoko Peninsula is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site. The area includes one of the world's densest concentrations of wild brown bears. 84-year-old fisherman Ose Hatsusaburo has forged a remarkable relationship with these creatures over a lifetime of working among them. Bears obey his commands without a fuss, and no fisherman has suffered a bear attack in 50 years. A rapidly shifting climate and recent UNESCO directives mean this unique way of life now faces an uncertain future.</content>

    <content>The COVID-19 pandemic is changing our lives in many ways, including how we work. Many white-collar jobs can now be done remotely, from anywhere with an internet connection. Meanwhile, "essential" workers, including nurses, risk their lives on the frontlines, often under miserable conditions and for low pay. Many hospitals are struggling to pay the bills. The pandemic has forced us to ask: "What jobs are truly important and how should they be compensated?" We look at 2 very different kinds of work in a search for answers.</content>

    <content>In the series Tokyo Miracle City, we unravel the secrets behind some of the capital's most intriguing wonders. In this fourth episode, we focus on Tokyo's "shinise" or long-established businesses. Tokyo is home to more than 3,000 shops and businesses with over a century of history. In the 20th century, Tokyo was razed to the ground twice, first by natural disaster, then by war, yet countless businesses found the resilience to rebuild and survive amid destruction and hardship. Actor Sato Takeru takes us on a tour of artisanal businesses keeping alive unique, age-old traditions, as he explores the roots of their longevity.</content>

    <content>On June 30, 2020, China's top legislature passed a new national security law for Hong Kong with far-reaching implications for residents of the territory. The new law came after more than a year of protests that at times saw the city rocked by scenes of violence and destruction. While some believe the law has helped bring Hong Kong back from the brink, many others are now afraid to even voice their views for fear of prosecution. In a city increasingly divided along political lines, we hear both the hopes and fears of Hongkongers caught up in these unprecedented times.</content>

    <content>Mysterious notes were unearthed near the ruins of the crematoriums at the Auschwitz concentration camp, the site of the mass extermination of Jews during World War II. Deciphered using cutting-edge digital technology, it was discovered the notes were written by Jews who were part of a special unit called the Sonderkommando, which assisted the Nazis in guiding fellow Jews to the gas chambers and cremating their corpses. These prisoners were deemed "traitors" amidst the shadows of the largest mass extermination program in human history. What took place within the inferno? More than 7 decades later, this disturbing, tragic reality is brought to light.</content>

    <content>How do you know if what you're reading is true or just a carefully crafted lie? Increasingly, social media exposes us to a flood of information, much of which aims to persuade us to believe things that are false. It can even encourage acts of violence. Fake images are being used in applications ranging from politics to pornography. And they're threatening our ability to tell fact from fiction. How can we stem the tide of bogus information? Or is it already too late?</content>

    <content>Every day, people willingly surrender their personal data in pursuit of entertainment or convenience. This information is stored in giant repositories, then used to track our movements, sell us products and determine our future. Technology now allows the creation of "digital twins," virtual copies of our real selves based on our search histories and online habits. But what are the human and social costs of these innovations? Will they bring us more freedom and opportunity? Or will they lead to increased loss of individual liberty? We explore the ongoing conflict between digital convenience and personal privacy.</content>

    <content>It's estimated over a million Japanese live as "hikikomori," recluses totally withdrawn from society. Some hikikomori may even go for decades without leaving their house. While in the past the phenomenon was most commonly associated with young men, recent data has revealed a much wider demographic of people whose confidence in themselves, and in society, has been shattered. As the parents or relatives hikikomori so often depend on entirely become too old to care for them, many now face a dire situation, left alone and unable to cope.</content>
