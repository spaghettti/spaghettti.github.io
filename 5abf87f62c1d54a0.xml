    <content>[BIZ STREAM SPECIAL EDITION]
This series of special editions feature selected stories from BIZ STREAM's signature "On-Site" reports. This episode examines how advances in the recycling of bio-waste are playing a key role in creating a more circular society. We feature a Japanese company that has found a way to extract hydroxyapatite (a key ingredient in making toothpaste and cosmetics) from eggshells, and another company that is turning sugar cane and other waste products into biofuel.</content>
    <description>From minerals found in eggshells to cotton extracted from second-hand clothing, this special edition shows how advances in recycling technology will help lead to a more circular society.</description>
