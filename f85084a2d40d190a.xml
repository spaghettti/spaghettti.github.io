    <content>As the Black Lives Matter protests continue across the U.S., there is another group fighting racism. Mirroring the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the number of hate incidents against people of Asian descent has also increased, and slanderous rhetoric like "China Virus" and "Kung Flu" are stoking racial tensions. How can we combat this stigma, prejudice and racism? We asked Dr. Russell Jeung, founder of an online organization that keeps track of racial incidents in the U.S.</content>

    <content>This year, as countries continue to grapple with the pandemic, there are many discussions about whether or not it is the right time to return to school. In the U.S., images of high school hallways packed with students not wearing facemasks went viral on social media, and in some states, schools have been forced to shut down shortly after reopening. But on the flipside, many students and their families are already experiencing difficulties with online learning. So, is this the right time to reopen schools? We asked the director of education UNESCO, Dr. Borhene Chakroun who joins us from Paris, France.</content>

    <content>Major League Baseball, National Basketball League, US Open Tennis and other major sports have resumed in the U.S. But with coronavirus safety restrictions in place, things are not the same, with fewer games, officials in masks, cardboard cutout fans and canned applause. Yet, despite these measures, some athletes have contracted the virus. So, is it worthwhile to hold sporting events, and what about the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics next year? We asked Sports Journalist, Matthew Futterman.</content>

    <content>2020 has become a historic year for women. Senator Kamala Harris will be the first woman and person of color to serve as Vice President of the United States. Women also made significant gains in both the House and the Senate. Still, the number of women who will hold seats in Congress is only about 26%, far from equal representation. How can we enhance women's participation in politics? And why is it important? We asked Debbie Walsh, who has been helping women run for public office.</content>

As the pandemic spread and the economy screeched to a halt, in the U.S., glaring income inequality and persistent racial disparities came to light.

But the events on January 6 may have lowered America's position. Some even say it was the darkest day in U.S. history. How will that day be remembered? What did it all mean?

    <content>Scientists began warning us about climate change a long time ago. International discussions about reducing greenhouse gas emissions have been ongoing, but no significant steps have been taken. In the interim, temperatures keep rising in many places, and extreme weather events are more frequent. Some say it is impossible to completely withdraw from carbon energies. But Mark Jacobson has a plan to replace them with 100% clean renewables. We asked Prof. Jacobson how we can tackle this issue.</content>

    <content>In late 2019, Akiko Iwasaki was alarmed about a new virus coming out of China. Reports revealed a possible respiratory infection which meant rapid transmission rates, and as she predicted, the virus soon spread worldwide. While vaccinations are now underway in the U.S. and other countries, variants have emerged, and cases are rising in some regions. So, are vaccines the light at the end of a long tunnel? Professor Iwasaki shares insights on vaccination, variants and the long-term effects of COVID-19.</content>

    <content>In the U.S., Federal officials announced that fully vaccinated Americans no longer need to wear masks outdoors in small groups, when dining outside, or biking and running. As vaccination rates pick up, people are starting to do some things they had stopped doing because of COVID-19. This makes us wonder how much longer this pandemic will last? When will we achieve "herd immunity"? And when can we return to our pre-pandemic lives? We asked Professor Iwasaki about the prospects for the near future.</content>

    <content>President Biden announced that the exit of US troops from Afghanistan would be completed by Sept. 11, 2021, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the U.S. But even after the US declaration, bombings have not ceased, and insurgencies cast a dark shadow on the country's future. What consequences will the withdrawal bring to the nation and to the U.S. itself? We asked Cheryl Benard, an expert on national security issues, post-conflict reconstruction, and author of books on Islamic countries.</content>
