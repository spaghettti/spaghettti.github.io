    <content>As the Black Lives Matter protests continue across the U.S., there is another group fighting racism. Mirroring the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the number of hate incidents against people of Asian descent has also increased, and slanderous rhetoric like "China Virus" and "Kung Flu" are stoking racial tensions. How can we combat this stigma, prejudice and racism? We asked Dr. Russell Jeung, founder of an online organization that keeps track of racial incidents in the U.S.</content>

    <content>This year, as countries continue to grapple with the pandemic, there are many discussions about whether or not it is the right time to return to school. In the U.S., images of high school hallways packed with students not wearing facemasks went viral on social media, and in some states, schools have been forced to shut down shortly after reopening. But on the flipside, many students and their families are already experiencing difficulties with online learning. So, is this the right time to reopen schools? We asked the director of education UNESCO, Dr. Borhene Chakroun who joins us from Paris, France.</content>

    <content>2020 has become a historic year for women. Senator Kamala Harris will be the first woman and person of color to serve as Vice President of the United States. Women also made significant gains in both the House and the Senate. Still, the number of women who will hold seats in Congress is only about 26%, far from equal representation. How can we enhance women's participation in politics? And why is it important? We asked Debbie Walsh, who has been helping women run for public office.</content>
