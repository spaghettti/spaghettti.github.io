    <content>Red miso from the Tokai region of Japan is famous as an ingredient in dishes such as Miso-katsu (pork cutlet covered in miso) and Miso-nikomi udon (udon noodles simmered in red miso broth). But when we asked people in Tokyo what they thought of it, their responses were far from positive. "The color is too dark." "I think of it as really salty." Little did they know that Tokai red miso is a versatile ingredient that can add rich flavor to all sorts of cuisine! It also has a chemical composition that makes food tastier the longer it's boiled -- a surprising trait among miso varieties. And despite its extremely dark color and deep flavor, it's actually relatively low in sodium. We explore the amazing, little-known power of red miso!</content>
