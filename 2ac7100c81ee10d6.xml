    <content>Lunch for Rie Tamakoshi, a ward office employee in Shizuoka Prefecture, is far from conventional. She eats rice balls on the run! She's too busy balancing work and raising her kids to sit down and enjoy lunch. During her lunch break, she runs home while she eats, and once at her house, she does the laundry, cleans, and preps dinner before running back to her office again.
In another segment, we visit the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa to meet a public health nurse who has a surprising lunch of her own.</content>

    <content>We go to Toyama Prefecture, central Japan to visit a factory that makes fishcake called "kamaboko." Although "kamaboko" is eaten all across Japan, those made here are especially decorative, as the local culture is to give them to guests who come to weddings and other celebratory occasions. Fresh fish is ground down to paste at 5 in the morning, and the product is shipped out in the evening. As the workers start so early, lunchtime comes at around 8. We look at the bento lunches of the fishcake makers.</content>

    <content>We go to Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan to visit a helicopter life flight team. The team consists of doctors, nurses, pilots, mechanics and dispatchers. They stand by at all times, ready to provide emergency care to patients in remote areas. For them, there's not a single second that can be wasted when a call comes in about a life that needs to be saved. When it comes to lunch, they eat when they can, but as soon as that call comes in, they jump right back into action.</content>

    <content>We visit an ironworks situated in Yamagata Prefecture, northern Japan. At the factory, there is a monthly lunch day wherein the staff take turns cooking soups from other countries. The task wouldn't be that difficult if they were allowed to use a recipe and have access to the right ingredients, but since the aim of this lunch tradition is to train the workers' ability to use their imagination to make things, the staff do just that, improvising as they go along.</content>

    <content>We visit a coffee plantation in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture. The plantation is run by a family, and what is surprising is that they only recently began growing coffee. They used to mainly grow flowers, but after suffering much damage from a typhoon, the father decided the switch on his own, without even running the numbers! To stay afloat, the son has to work hard, but he has no complaints because the coffee they make tastes great, and his father is having the time of his life!</content>

    <content>We visit a restaurant of Okinawan cuisine, not in the tropical prefecture of Okinawa, but in Niigata Prefecture, a snowy region by the Sea of Japan. The restaurant manager, who is a huge fan of the program, cooks lunch for his staff every day, and does so using "mentsuyu," the standard noodle sauce of Japan. Whether it be meat sauce or curry, he always uses noodle sauce. In fact, he's so into cooking with noodle sauce that he dreams of one day publishing his own cookbook of his ingenious noodle sauce dishes.</content>

Every morning, 2 purchasers from the factory go to the market to buy fresh mackerel, which are canned that very day. Although their factory was destroyed by the terrible tsunami of 2011, their mackerel cans miraculously survived, and that story gave the local people hope right when they were faced with the daunting task of rebuilding their community.</content>

    <content>We go to Hyogo Prefecture, western Japan to visit a factory that handcrafts scissors for hairstylists. Scissors for cutting hair have to cut extremely well, and the process to customize scissors so that they can do just that demands unthinkable exactness. At this factory, they even handle repairs of scissors that are decades old, but that task can only be carried out by the best, most experienced technicians. Tune in to find out the detailed work of scissor crafters and also what they do for lunch.</content>

    <content>Mt. Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan, and at its summit, there is a shrine. The man who cooks for the shrine priests 3 times a day is actually a total amateur. However, he does have a lot of experience as a mountaineer, and that's what landed him the job. And it's okay that he's not the most experienced chef, because he is armed with recipes written by his beloved wife. Plus, if even that is not enough, he can always call her to ask for emergency cooking advice!</content>

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the local people had been unable to go to their beloved temple during spring this year, but in summer, the temple decided to hold memorial services for the local people during the Obon Festival, a period when Japanese people honor the spirits of their ancestors. Behind the scenes, one of the senior monks cooks up a filling vegetable curry so that the hard-chanting monks can charge up on energy!</content>
