    <content>Lunch for Rie Tamakoshi, a ward office employee in Shizuoka Prefecture, is far from conventional. She eats rice balls on the run! She's too busy balancing work and raising her kids to sit down and enjoy lunch. During her lunch break, she runs home while she eats, and once at her house, she does the laundry, cleans, and preps dinner before running back to her office again.
In another segment, we visit the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa to meet a public health nurse who has a surprising lunch of her own.</content>

    <content>We go to Toyama Prefecture, central Japan to visit a factory that makes fishcake called "kamaboko." Although "kamaboko" is eaten all across Japan, those made here are especially decorative, as the local culture is to give them to guests who come to weddings and other celebratory occasions. Fresh fish is ground down to paste at 5 in the morning, and the product is shipped out in the evening. As the workers start so early, lunchtime comes at around 8. We look at the bento lunches of the fishcake makers.</content>

    <content>We go to Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan to visit a helicopter life flight team. The team consists of doctors, nurses, pilots, mechanics and dispatchers. They stand by at all times, ready to provide emergency care to patients in remote areas. For them, there's not a single second that can be wasted when a call comes in about a life that needs to be saved. When it comes to lunch, they eat when they can, but as soon as that call comes in, they jump right back into action.</content>

    <content>We visit an ironworks situated in Yamagata Prefecture, northern Japan. At the factory, there is a monthly lunch day wherein the staff take turns cooking soups from other countries. The task wouldn't be that difficult if they were allowed to use a recipe and have access to the right ingredients, but since the aim of this lunch tradition is to train the workers' ability to use their imagination to make things, the staff do just that, improvising as they go along.</content>

    <content>We visit a coffee plantation in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture. The plantation is run by a family, and what is surprising is that they only recently began growing coffee. They used to mainly grow flowers, but after suffering much damage from a typhoon, the father decided the switch on his own, without even running the numbers! To stay afloat, the son has to work hard, but he has no complaints because the coffee they make tastes great, and his father is having the time of his life!</content>

    <content>We visit a restaurant of Okinawan cuisine, not in the tropical prefecture of Okinawa, but in Niigata Prefecture, a snowy region by the Sea of Japan. The restaurant manager, who is a huge fan of the program, cooks lunch for his staff every day, and does so using "mentsuyu," the standard noodle sauce of Japan. Whether it be meat sauce or curry, he always uses noodle sauce. In fact, he's so into cooking with noodle sauce that he dreams of one day publishing his own cookbook of his ingenious noodle sauce dishes.</content>

Every morning, 2 purchasers from the factory go to the market to buy fresh mackerel, which are canned that very day. Although their factory was destroyed by the terrible tsunami of 2011, their mackerel cans miraculously survived, and that story gave the local people hope right when they were faced with the daunting task of rebuilding their community.</content>

    <content>We go to Hyogo Prefecture, western Japan to visit a factory that handcrafts scissors for hairstylists. Scissors for cutting hair have to cut extremely well, and the process to customize scissors so that they can do just that demands unthinkable exactness.

Tune in to find out the detailed work of scissor crafters and also what they do for lunch.</content>

However, he does have a lot of experience as a mountaineer, and that's what landed him the job. And it's okay that he's not the most experienced chef, because he is armed with recipes written by his beloved wife. Plus, if even that is not enough, he can always call her to ask for emergency cooking advice!</content>

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the local people had been unable to go to their beloved temple during spring this year, but in summer, the temple decided to hold memorial services for the local people during the Obon Festival, a period when Japanese people honor the spirits of their ancestors. Behind the scenes, one of the senior monks cooks up a filling vegetable curry so that the hard-chanting monks can charge up on energy!</content>

    <content>In the district of Tomonoura, Hiroshima Prefecture, there is a company that offers a golf cart taxi service. Even though the carts are slow, they have many advantages: their small size allows easy passage through narrow alleyways, and since there are no windows, it's easy to greet neighbors when passing them by on the street. We follow a man who drives this taxi, and discover where he always has delicious lunch.</content>

    <content>The pandemic has been keeping our crew from filming, so we've been asking people to send in lunch reports they've filmed themselves instead. The thing is, we realized that there is an entire group of people in Japan who would be perfect for such reports: former TV directors. In this episode, we feature an excellent report by former TV director Ms. Yasuda, who now runs a company with her father that produces spicy cod roe. For lunch, Ms. Yasuda's father cooks up a wonderful meal for the staff.</content>

    <content>The city of Amagasaki in Hyogo Prefecture, western Japan is home to the leading wrapped sake barrel manufacturer in Japan. The traditional barrel they make is called Komodaru, and it is often used for celebratory occasions. Each barrel is handcrafted carefully with rice straw. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for the barrel has plummeted, but even in such a difficult situation, the crafters are able to work hard, thanks in no small part to the delicious bentos they have for lunch.</content>

    <content>We visit a bus company that has been in business for over 100 years in the city of Ina, Nagano Prefecture, in central Japan. The company was hit hard in 2020 by the pandemic, and they were forced to cease all of their bus tours for several months. However, the bus guides didn't waste their time just sitting around in self-isolation. They instead got together to think of all-new, Covid-safe bus tours that would be appealing for local customers. Their hard work paid off, and after 6 months, the company was able to resume bus tours. We look at the hearty food served at their cafeteria.</content>

    <content>Tsurumi, Osaka Prefecture, in western Japan is home to one of the country's biggest soap factories. Since the factory's establishment 112 years ago, they have made soap bars in gigantic vats through the same process. The old-fashioned method requires the professionals in charge to fully put their 5 senses to use to detect the slightest things that even high-tech machines cannot. And when it comes time for lunch, we join the professional soap makers at the company cafeteria to check out what they eat!</content>
