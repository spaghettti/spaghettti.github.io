    <content>Lunch for Rie Tamakoshi, a ward office employee in Shizuoka Prefecture, is far from conventional. She eats rice balls on the run! She's too busy balancing work and raising her kids to sit down and enjoy lunch. During her lunch break, she runs home while she eats, and once at her house, she does the laundry, cleans, and preps dinner before running back to her office again.
In another segment, we visit the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa to meet a public health nurse who has a surprising lunch of her own.</content>

    <content>We go to Toyama Prefecture, central Japan to visit a factory that makes fishcake called "kamaboko." Although "kamaboko" is eaten all across Japan, those made here are especially decorative, as the local culture is to give them to guests who come to weddings and other celebratory occasions. Fresh fish is ground down to paste at 5 in the morning, and the product is shipped out in the evening. As the workers start so early, lunchtime comes at around 8. We look at the bento lunches of the fishcake makers.</content>

    <content>We go to Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan to visit a helicopter life flight team. The team consists of doctors, nurses, pilots, mechanics and dispatchers. They stand by at all times, ready to provide emergency care to patients in remote areas. For them, there's not a single second that can be wasted when a call comes in about a life that needs to be saved. When it comes to lunch, they eat when they can, but as soon as that call comes in, they jump right back into action.</content>

    <content>Mt. Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan, and at its summit, there is a shrine. The man who cooks for the shrine priests 3 times a day is actually a total amateur. However, he does have a lot of experience as a mountaineer, and that's what landed him the job. And it's okay that he's not the most experienced chef, because he is armed with recipes written by his beloved wife. Plus, if even that is not enough, he can always call her to ask for emergency cooking advice!</content>

    <content>We visit Chiba, the prefecture that neighbors Tokyo, to go to one of Japan's largest mushroom farms. At the farm, they grow massive amounts of mushrooms but surprisingly, each mushroom is harvested by hand. To feed their hard-working employees, the farm renovated what was formerly the home economics room of a school to set up their very own bento kitchen. At the kitchen, they cook up delicious dishes that feature a whole lot of mushrooms, every day!</content>

    <content>The Shinshu Buddhist Otani-ha Sect Namba Betsuin Temple in Osaka Prefecture, western Japan, has been loved by the local people since it was founded in 1595. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the local people had been unable to go to their beloved temple during spring this year, but in summer, the temple decided to hold memorial services for the local people during the Obon Festival, a period when Japanese people honor the spirits of their ancestors. Behind the scenes, one of the senior monks cooks up a filling vegetable curry so that the hard-chanting monks can charge up on energy!</content>

    <content>We set up a video camera in the cafeteria of a company in Tokyo that makes all kinds of educational products. With the camera, equipped with a mic and speakers, we remotely interview the workers who sit down to eat lunch. First, we talk with a group of ladies who work from home a few days a week. Then, we talk with a man who used to travel across the country all the time for work. Since the pandemic, he's been unable to travel at all, so he eats an Okinawan dish to at least travel in spirit!</content>
