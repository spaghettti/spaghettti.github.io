    <content>The coronavirus has led to a rise in home dining. And as a result people are more concerned about what they put into their bodies. Amid this trend, produce from small scale farms is becoming increasingly popular. Consumers are able to buy fresh vegetables direct from farmers, via the Internet. And the products are often grown in a safer, more environmentally friendly way than those that are mass-produced. For farmers, the system not only offers greater profits, but the opportunity to make a contribution toward a sustainable future for society. We take a look at some examples in Japan.
Guests:
Akimoto Rina (Founder of a direct sales platform for produce)
Miyata Hiroaki (Professor, Keio University)
Sekine Kae (Associate Professor, Aichi Gakuin University)

    <description>As the pandemic changes societal values, small scale farming is increasingly seen as a viable new lifestyle. We look at how the agriculture sector is leading the push for a sustainable world.</description>

    <content>Japan's hanko seals have been an essential requirement for day-to-day documents and official forms for many years. But a government push to bring workplace practices and administrative procedures fully into the digital era has put pressure on businesses and city authorities to eliminate the seals from most paperwork. We look at what the shift away from this long-running custom means for Japan, and some of the hurdles that are presenting themselves along the way.
Guests:

Watanabe Yuichiro (Member of the Board, Japan In-House Lawyers Association)

    <description>The use of hanko seals on official forms and documents is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture. But a society-wide shift to digital work practices is forcing many to question the need for them.</description>

    <content>The Tokyo Olympic Games are due to open in eight months' time, but can they really be held while the coronavirus pandemic shows no sign of ending? An international gymnastics competition held in Tokyo in early November was used as a test event.

NHK went behind the scenes to see what will be necessary to safely hold the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

    <content>In the latest Global Gender Gap Index survey, Japan came 121st out of 153 countries, and was the lowest among major advanced nations. The government is aiming to have women in 30 percent of leadership roles by 2020, but the figure currently stands at just 14.8 percent. What does Japanese society need to do to change this? Overcoming "unconscious bias" might be the answer. NHK took a close look at how some companies are trying to tackle this issue to find out the key to creating a workplace where women can shine.

    <content>More than 1,300 farm animals, including pigs, calves, and goats, were stolen this summer in Japan's Kanto region. During the investigation, local police arrested a group of Vietnamese nationals on suspicion of overstaying their visas. Their connection to the thefts is still unclear but NHK followed a trail of social media posts advertising butchered pigs. We learned about the tough situation faced by Vietnamese technical trainees, and how the pandemic is making things even more difficult.</content>
    <description>Recent reports of stolen farm animals north of Tokyo shed light on the increasingly tough situation faced by Vietnamese technical trainees in Japan. We take a deeper look at their plight.</description>

    <content>On December 6, Japan's Hayabusa2 probe successfully returned a capsule to Earth after a six-year voyage through space. It is believed to contain sub-surface materials collected on Ryugu, an asteroid some 300-million kilometers away. They may shed light on the origins of life on Earth. The mission faced a series of unexpected challenges and NHK went behind the scenes to see how the team achieved the extraordinary feat of two touchdowns on Ryugu and the safe return of the sample container.
