To reduce waste, shops started charging for plastic shopping bags in July. But the amount of plastic waste generated by households is increasing due to COVID-19. We visit Kamakura, which was the first city in Japan to make a \"zero plastic waste\" declaration. In addition, bioplastics are attracting attention as they are kind to nature and recyclable options. Some are made from plant-derived materials and some are decomposed by microorganisms. We visit the laboratory of Professor Iwata Tadahisa of the University of Tokyo, who is a leader in this field.
