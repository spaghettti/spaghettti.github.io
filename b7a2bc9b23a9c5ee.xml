    <content>Deep in the mountains of Tochigi Prefecture, 100 kilometers north of Tokyo, Ashio has long been known as a mining town. Copper deposits were first discovered there 400 years ago and mining continued there until the 1970’s. In its heyday, the mine produced 40 percent of all of Japan’s copper and nearly 40,000 people lived in the area. Although mining brought prosperity, it also created massive pollution: Ashio became infamous as the site of the country’s first major pollution disaster. Sulfur dioxide gas from the refining process killed off the surrounding forests. And huge amounts of toxic chemicals were carried downstream to the lowlands by the Watarase River. Potter Euan Craig grew up in Bendigo, southeastern Australia, a community that also suffered from the effects of mining pollution. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Euan travels to Ashio to see for himself how people have brought life back to the mountains, thanks to a massive reforestation program. He also visits the Watarase Retarding Basin in the lowlands, and observes how it too has taken on a new life.</content>
    <description>In Ashio (Tochigi Pref.), Euan Craig see how forests are now returning at the site of a former copper mine. On this program, get to know the real Japan and discover useful travel tips.</description>
