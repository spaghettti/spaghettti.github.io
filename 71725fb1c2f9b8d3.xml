Participants are sent food and drinks from the tour destination in advance and are able to enjoy them while watching and listening to the tour conductor from the comfort of their homes. Realizing that these virtual tours can allow customers to join from anywhere in the world, the tour company has also created tours for foreign clients.</content>
