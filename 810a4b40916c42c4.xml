    <content>Spring 2019 saw the return of some of the former residents of Okuma Town, Fukushima Prefecture who had evacuated due to high radiation. Instrumental in this were 6 former town employees, aged 66 on average, known as the "Grandpa Troop." These men spent 6 years maintaining affected areas, believing that residents could someday return. Following the partial lifting of an evacuation order, the troop disbanded this spring. We look at what inspired them to clear a path for the younger generation.</content>

    <content>Hirosaki Park in northern Japan is one of the country's finest cherry blossom sites. Nowhere in the world do cherry trees bloom so fully and close together. The overwhelming density of the striking pink flowers is a result of the region's distinctive pruning techniques. Showers of petals in the wind and the blanket of fallen blossoms that covers the park's moats, are astonishing to see. Using drones as well as high-speed and time-lapse filming techniques, the program is shot with high-definition cameras capturing the beautiful, shifting life cycle of the flowers.</content>
