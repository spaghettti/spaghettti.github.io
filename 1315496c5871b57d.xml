    <content>Facing the Seto Inland Sea, sunny Kagawa Prefecture historically overcame a lack of natural resources and water through skill and hard work. Despite having no local bamboo or paper, Kagawa artisans created paper fans famed for their quality. Bonsai grow well in this dry climate, and Kagawa's have won fans worldwide. After a taste of Wasanbon sweets, prized for centuries for their delicate sweetness, we cross to a small island to sample soy sauce made the traditional way. A trip of tough but rewarding climbs, reflecting the spirit of Kagawa.</content>
    <description>A ride from one edge to the other of Japan's smallest prefecture, where a relative scarcity of natural resources has been historically offset by an unrelenting drive to create outstanding quality.</description>

    <content>In the city of Hiroshima we visit a community where the families who survived the devastation of the atomic bomb in the Second World War managed to revive their traditional farming specialty. In the islands to the south, we meet a potter uniquely making glazes from cast-off oyster shells, and in the mountains, a farmer tells of his passion for making animals happy. The last individual we encounter who has stuck to his own path in life is a carver of traditional instruments seeking the perfect sound.</content>
    <description>We discover how people live today in the city and prefecture of Hiroshima, where society has long since returned to normal after the devastation of the atomic bombing more than 75 years ago.</description>
