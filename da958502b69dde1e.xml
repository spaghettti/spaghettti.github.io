    <content>Nantarika Chansue is a Thai veterinarian who specializes in aquatic animals. For over 30 years, she's treated everything from fish to turtles and even whales. She insists that no matter how grave the injury, all animals deserve a chance at recovery, so she's implemented medical techniques formerly used only with humans, such as casting prostheses. Many of the injuries sustained by the animals are due to human negligence, which Nantarika strongly opposes for the safety of aquatic life.</content>
